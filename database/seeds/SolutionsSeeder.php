                    <p>A New Molecular Entity (NME) is defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an active ingredient that has never been marketed before in any form. However, drugs need not to be a new chemical entity for it to be considered new, as changes in an old and established drug may be considered novel if modifications applied to it introduce a question to its safety or efficacy, such as in the following circumstances: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Alteration in an approved drug product’s formulation or manufacturing method </p></li>
                        <li><p>Combination of two or more old drugs or alteration in a usual combination product </p></li>
                        <li><p>Proposition of new indication, new dosage schedule or regimen, new route of administration, and/ or  new dosage form for an established drug </p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Throughout history, some drugs were found as a result of fortuitous discovery, but most as a result in the tireless pursuit of carefully designed research programs of screening, molecular modification and mechanism-based drug design. The discovery of a new chemical entity involves processes such as (1) isolation from plants, (2) synthesis in the laboratory or organic synthesis, and (3) creation through the process of biotechnology or molecular modification. Nowadays, new drugs are being discovered as a result of a more targeted chemical or engineered biologic material research; which is, directed specifically toward the identified physiologic/ metabolic process or biomolecular target of a disease.  </p>
                    <p>Out of 270,000 known plants, only a few have been investigated for its medicinal activity. Plants have long serve as a reservoir, and are one of the main sources of potential new drugs. Once the active constituents have been isolated and structurally identified from the plant, organic chemists may either recreate them through total laboratory synthesis or, more importantly, use the natural chemical as a starting material in the creation of a slightly different molecularly-modified chemical. Depending on the nature and extent of the chemical alteration, these new structures which are called semisynthetic drugs, may have a slightly or vastly different pharmacologic activity from that of the starting substance. Other plant constituents that are inertly inactive or rather unimportant therapeutically may be chemically modified to yield important drugs with profound pharmacologic activity.  </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, animals have served humans in their search for drugs in numerous ways.  Not only have they yielded to drug testing and biologic assay, but have also provided drugs that are mannered from their tissues or through their biologic processes. More than this, use of animals also holds lifesaving significance in the production of various biologic products (e.g., serums, antitoxin, and vaccines). New <a href="https://escovaccixcell.com/applications/vaccines/cancer-vaccine"><strong>vaccines</strong></a> for diseases such as AIDs and cancer have been developed through the use of cell and tissue cultures. </p>
                    <p>In the new era today, the pharmaceutical product development is seen as a result of the advent of genetic engineering, the submicroscopic manipulation of the double helix, the spiral DNA chain of life. Through this process, more abundant and vastly purer antibiotics, vaccines and yet unknown chemical and biologic products to combat human diseases have yet to come.    </p>
                    <p>Another new promising technology is the human gene therapy which entails the transfer of a new genetic material to the cells of a patient with a genetic disease. It is used to prevent, treat, cure, diagnose, or mitigate human diseases caused by genetic disorders. Gene therapy is a medical intervention that is based on the modification of the genetic material of living cells. Cells may be modified outside the body <em>(ex vivo)</em> for subsequent administration, or they may be modified within the body <em>(in vivo)</em> by gene therapy products given directly to the patient.   </p>
                    <p>In dealing with chemicals whose properties have yet to be studied, proper engineering controls must be utilized in research laboratories to ensure safety throughout the whole developmental process.    </p>
                    <p>Esco Pharma provides specialist services, equipment packages, and process solutions from our core platform products. This leads to improved protection of operators, reduction of cross-contamination, and a more efficient processing; thereby, directly and indirectly advancing occupational health and human healthcare.  </p>

                    <p>Once a new chemical entity has been discovered, it must undergo pre-clinical testing to determine whether it possesses adequate features of safety, and sufficient promise of usefulness to be pursued as a prospective pharmaceutical drug product. The proposed new drug is then biologically characterized to determine its pharmacologic and toxicologic effects.  </p>

                    <p>Pre-clinical testing involves the effort of various scientists and takes about six and a half (6.5) years to be completed. It deals with the initial synthesis and characterization of new drug which includes the study on the following: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>new chemical entity’s chemistry/ physical properties/ biology (pharmacology, ADME, toxicology) </p></li>
                        <li><p>preformulation </p></li>
                        <li><p>long-term animal toxicity/ animal testing </p></li>
                        <li><p>product formulation </p></li>
                        <li><p>manufacturing and controls; and,  </p></li>
                        <li><p>package and label design </p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Preformulation studies are then conducted to define the physicochemical properties of the agent, while formulation studies follow in order to develop the initial features of the proposed pharmaceutical product or dosage form.  </p>

                    <p>To acquire proof to demonstrate the drug’s safety and effectiveness for its proposed use, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies must be completed. Scientists have developed studies that may be conducted outside the living body <em>(ex vivo)</em> through cell and tissue culture, and computer programs which simulate the human and animal systems. Cell cultures are being used increasingly to screen for toxicity before progressing to whole-animal testing. </p>

                    <p>When the pre-clinical studies demonstrate adequate safety and the new agent shows promise as a useful drug, the drug’s sponsor (e.g., pharmaceutical company) can file an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for initial testing in humans (often called as phase 1 of clinical trial). </p>

                    <p>In dealing with chemicals whose properties have yet to be studied, proper engineering controls must be utilized in research laboratories to ensure safety throughout the whole developmental process.  </p>

                    <p>For pharmaceutical and lab animal research, air showers can be integrated to maintain the cleanliness of the pharmaceutical production and laboratory animal breeding areas. It can also minimize egress of hazardous substances and allergens from the controlled environment. </p>

                    <p>As these trials progress, laboratory work is continuously done to define the agent’s basic and clinical pharmacology, toxicology, product design and development, manufacturing scale-up and process-controls, analytical methods and development, proposed labeling and package design, and initial plans for marketing. </p>

                    <h4>Phase 1</h4>
                    <p>Human subjects who volunteer to participate in Phase 1 studies are usually in healthy conditions; although, there might be some exceptions due to certain protocols which necessitate patients to be their subjects. These trials typically involve 20-100 subjects who are closely monitored by clinical experts in such investigations. </p>
                    <p>Phase 1 trials deal with the initial introduction of an investigational drug into humans, and are primarily designed for the <strong>purpose of assessing its safety</strong>. Studies in this phase include the determination of the following:  </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>human pharmacology of the drug  </p></li>
                        <li><p>structure-activity relationships  </p></li>
                        <li><p>side effects associated with increasing doses; and if possible,  </p></li>
                        <li><p>early evidence of its effectiveness </p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Phase 1 studies are often used for the selection among different chemical analogs of a lead compound. Lead compound is a prototype compound which possesses the fundamentally desired biologic or pharmacologic activity of a chemical.  </p>
                    <p>Once studies demonstrate sufficient merit and if the order of the drug toxicity is low, Phase 2 begins.  </p>


                    <h4>Phase 2</h4>
                    <p>Unlike in Phase 1 trials which involve around 20-100 healthy volunteers, Phase 2 trials study up to several hundred patients, and since this phase has patients as subjects, side effects or toxicity symptoms that did not appear in the preclinical animal or Phase 1 studies, may be revealed for the first time.  </p>
                    <p>Controlled clinical studies are conducted during this phase in order to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug in patients with the condition in which the drug is intended for and also to be able to assess the side effects and risks that may arise. Only clinicians expert in the disease being treated are used as investigators for phase 2.  </p>
                    <p>Once the clinical results of Phase 2 demonstrate continued promise for the new drug with a good margin of safety then, the drug’s sponsor (e.g. pharmaceutical company) and the FDA’s review division can hold meetings for the analysis of data acquired from phases 1 and 2. Furthermore, these meetings allow resolution for questions and issues and aid in the establishment of investigational plans for Phase 3 studies.   </p>

                    <h4>Phase 3 </h4>
                    <p>In order to determine the drug’s usefulness in an expanded patient base, Phase 3 studies include controlled and uncontrolled trials that may be participated by several hundred to several thousand patients. Many additional clinicians with patients who have the condition for the drug’s intended use are recruited to participate in this trial.   </p>
                    <p>The end goals of Phase 3 studies are to gather adequate information on the drug’s efficacy and safety for the evaluation of its overall benefit-risk relationship, and to be able to file a complete New Drug Application (NDA).  </p>
                    <p>Getting an NDA approval from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicates that the body of scientific evidence submitted sufficiently demonstrates that the drug product is safe and effective for its proposed clinical indications, that there is adequate assurance of its proper manufacture and control, and that the final labeling accurately presents the necessary information for its proper use.  </p>
                    <p>At the end of the clinical research, an NDA is filed in order to seek for approval to market the new product. This takes an average of one and a half (1.5) year to process, and is comprised of the following steps: </p>

                <p>Classical <a href="/solutions/by-drug-development-process">drug development</a> employs working with small, chemically manufactured active substances, which served as the bedrock for medical research and therapeutics. These intracellular targeting substances are small molecules with a molecular weight of less than 900 Daltons (Da). Such substances are usually organic compounds with well-defined structures but with low drug specificity. They aid in regulating biological processes mainly through metabolic degradation. Some examples of these include 2-Aminooxyacetic acid (AOA or AOAA), a derivative of hydroxylamine, and acetylsalicylic acid commonly known as aspirin. </p>

                <p>Due to their size, composition, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and suitability for certain drug forms over others, these small therapeutic molecules confer certain advantages over large ones or biologics. Some of these advantages include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increase in patient accessibility and compliance, since small molecules are majorly orally administered; </li>

                    <li>Easier synthesis as they involve less complex processes, thus, less rigorous manufacturing activities. </li>

                    <p>ADCs unlike most conventional cancer therapies have the ability to discriminate between the healthy and diseased tissue. Paul Ehrlich coined the term “magic bullets”, as studies reveal that several human cancers selectively express cell surface antigens, thus, offering an opportunity for mAbs to target each particular antigen as part of chemotherapy. Due to this specificity and advantageous quality, there has been a great demand for their development in the oncology field.

                    <br>

                    To date, five (5) ADCs - brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris), trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla),1−3 gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg), inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa), and very recently, polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy) - have been approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); currently, over a hundred mABs are being investigated in various stages of clinical trials.

                    <br>

                    When designing an ADC several issues must be taken into consideration as each step is critical to their action as a therapeutic agent for cancer; this is also one of the main reason why only a small number of ADCs have reached the market today.

                    In line with the manufacturing, processing, and packaging of drugs, medical devices, some food, and blood components, compliance to international and state regulations is required to ensure that these products are safe, pure and effective once released in the market.

                    <br>

                    Since 2003, ADCs are being reviewed by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), one of the centers within FDA. Furthermore, the current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) is also one of the regulations enforced by the FDA. This formal system of controls, when adequately put into practice, helps in preventing instances of contamination, mix-ups, deviations, failures, and errors, and ensures that drug products meet their quality standards. In addition, current ADCs are known to be highly potent substances, therefore appropriate containment are needed to address potential cross-contamination in multi-product facilities.

            'details' => 'Compounding is the art and science of preparing personalized medications for patients. The compounded medications are prepared based on a medical/dental doctor’s prescription. Compounding are usually done in hospitals, community pharmacies and even to other outsourcing facilities that caters the needs of other hospitals without sufficient compounding facility. To avoid the health risks and the associated economic burden of unsterile compounding, isolators are used with the proper observance of the international guidelines for compounding drugs.',
            'content' => '
                <p>Although compounding may occur in different settings, it is most commonly done in pharmacies. Compounding in general is a practice where a licensed pharmacist, a licensed physician, or in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters the ingredients of a drug to create a sterile or non-sterile preparation tailored to the needs of individual patients.
                <br>
                <br>
                These are usually provided when an FDA-approved drug is not medically suitable for the treatment of a patient. Example of which can be when someone is allergic to a certain dye and needs a medication to be made without it. Another scenario would be of an elderly patient or a child who is unable to swallow a tablet or capsule, hence requiring a medicine in a liquid dosage form.
                <br>
                <br>
                Compounded drugs serve an important medical need for patients, but at the same time may present certain risks as they do not have the same safety, quality, and efficacy validation as compared to approved drugs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Drugs compounded in outsourcing facilities are subject to current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. While, drugs compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a state-licensed pharmacy, or federal facility, or by a physician, in accordance with the conditions of section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), are exempt from compliance with CGMP requirements; however, these facilities can still be subject to less stringent quality standards set per state.
                <br>
                <br>
                Regardless of where compounding occurs (e.g., pharmacy, outsourcing facility, physician’s office), these drugs must not be prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions. Poor compounding practices can cause serious drug quality problems, such as contamination or dispensing of medications that do not possess the strength, quality, and purity that the drugs are supposed to have; these factors can then lead to serious patient injury and death.

Consequently, the benefits and the harmful effects of these agents co-exists with each other opting the use of lead-lined isolators and other containment methods that can block radiation.',
            'content' => '
                <p>Nuclear medicine requires the use of radioactive materials or radioactive tracers (radiopharmaceuticals) to assess bodily functions, and to diagnose and treat diseases most notably, for various forms of cancer.
                <br>
                <br>
                Therapeutic uses of radioactive materials are typically intended to kill cancerous tissue, reduce tumor size, or reduce pain. Meanwhile, diagnostic procedures generally involve the use of relatively small amounts of radioactive materials to facilitate in the imaging of certain organs. These radioactive materials aid physicians in locating and identifying tumors, size anomalies, or other physiological or functional organ problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                Specially designed cameras allow physicians to track the path of these radioactive tracers. Two of the imaging modalities which are most commonly used are Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans.
                <br>
                <br>
                When preparing radiopharmaceuticals or when radiolabeling biologic products (e.g., MABs, peptides), aseptic technique and methods must be maintained throughout the entire process since a significant majority of these are produced for parenteral route.
                <br>
                <br>
                Standard procedures, best practices, facilities, and equipment for the preparation and dispensing of radiopharmaceuticals are also essential to any radiopharmaceutical-related operations. Appropriate engineering controls and work practices are essential to provide operator, product, and environmental protection against exposure to radioactivity. Notably, the use of engineering controls and proper standard operating procedures do not totally eliminate radiation, rather, it only minimizes or attenuates the dose that the operator is exposed to.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moreover, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) also establishes and enforces radiation safety standards (e.g., limits for radiation doses, levels of radiation in an area, concentrations of radioactivity in air and waste water, waste disposal precautionary procedures) for the compounding facility.

            <strong>Containment of Nanomaterials</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            In dealing specifically with nanomedicine, the application of nanotechnology in medicine, exposure to potentially hazardous nanoscale substances via inhalation of airborne materials can cause hazard to the operator.
            <br>
            <br>
            In light of controlling and reducing operator exposure to potential hazards, engineering control techniques such as source enclosure (i.e., isolating the generation source from the worker) and local exhaust ventilation systems must be utilized to properly contain and exhaust out airborne nanomaterials.
            <br>
            <br>
            Integrated with these controls should be a set of guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) defined to minimize operator exposure to nanomaterials and other potentially hazardous chemicals.

            <strong>Protection of Nanoscale Products</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Below is a list of industries that typically utilize nanotechnology:
            <ul>
            <li>Cancer treatment as a means of targeting specific cancer cells and neoplasms during surgical resection of tumors and other treatment modalities that can enhance the drug’s therapeutic efficacy.</li>

            <li>Energy industry that deals with the construction of solar panels and related equipment; and,</li>

            <li>Transportation industry which develops multifunctional materials that contributes to building and maintaining lighter, safer, smarter and more efficient vehicles, aircrafts, spacecrafts, and ships.</li>
            </ul>
            Particulate contamination in products handled in these industries can greatly affect the nanoscale equipment functioning of the product. Hence, facilities handling nanotechnology must utilize cleanrooms and other engineering controls which help in maintaining the air quality of the critical work zone, and its surrounding environment. In addition, integrations that can help in minimizing cross-contamination risks can also also be utilized to sustain the required environment for efficient and suitable processing.

                <p>Quality control is an essential operation in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical drug products must be marketed as safe and therapeutically active formulations with consistent and predictable properties and performance.

                According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the term quality control refers to the sum of all procedures undertaken to ensure the identity and purity of a particular pharmaceutical.
                <br>
                <br>
                Quality control in particular is the area of good manufacturing practices (GMP) which deals with processes involving sampling, specifications and testing, and with the organization, documentation and release procedures.

                This attribute of a pharmaceutical preparation cannot be easily measured and assured during in-process inspection and finished-product testing, since every stage of the manufacturing process affects the properties of the drug. This key fact opens up the necessity to properly train all personnel-- from the basic concepts of assuring quality like donning on their personal protective equipment (PPE) prior to entering production sites; up to the complex protocols of aseptic technique.

                It is also important to note that quality control is not confined to laboratory operations but must be involved in all decisions concerning the quality of the product; from the purchasing and storage of raw materials, to the in-process quality control testing, up until the labelling and packaging of the final product.

                <br>
                Highly potent active pharmaceutical ingredients (HPAPIs) are pharmacologically active substances that exhibit biological activity at extremely low concentrations, such as daily therapeutic dose of <10 mg or an occupational exposure limit (OEL) of < 10 μg/m3 at an eight hour time-weighted average.
                <br>
                <br>
                Each HPAPIs have specific OEL that must be considered by an institution to guarantee safe handling, as there is a selective process in choosing the most appropriate strategy for containment.

                <strong>Recent Pharmaceutical Market</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                The continuous expansion of the biopharmaceutical market, particularly, the global demand in the field of medical oncology, calls for an increase in the development and conventional drug manufacturing of high potency active pharmaceutical ingredients (HPAPIs). Within the next 5 years, the value for cancer medication is estimated to reach 100 billion USD.
                <br>
                <br>
                Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), which use very toxic molecules specifically targeting cancer cells serve as one example for HPAPIs. These compounds represent an advancement in oncology treatment being highly potent cytotoxic drugs that do not harm the healthy cells unlike conventional chemotherapy.
                <br>
                <br>
                The major problem with this is that human intervention is present at almost every stage of the manufacturing process, thus, increasing the risk for personnel exposure. This could lead to various adverse health effects to all personnel involved; that is why, ensuring the safety of the manufacturing personnel is of high importance. However, addressing this issue should not impede productivity.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the manufacture of these highly potent compounds, specialized considerations are needed to be deliberated for the facility design, equipment, operation, and safety to achieve the best level of containment of the drug product.</p>

            <p>
            Dr. Albert Kligman of the University of Pennsylvania is described as the father of cosmeceuticals, a term he popularized. Cosmeceuticals are hybrid products which provide beyond simple cosmetic enhancement but fell short in qualifying as a pharmaceutical. Since mid-1980s, the term has already existed, but it first appeared in the world market in 1996.
            <br>
            <br>
            Cosmetics, first recorded to be used by Egyptians in 4000 B.C., are products which cleanse and beautify the skin. While, pharmaceuticals are drug products which prevent, mitigate, treat or cure disease and/or affect the body’s structure or function.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although the term ‘cosmeceuticals’ has been used in many reputable journal articles, it remains unrecognized by the U.S. food and drug administration (FDA) and other regulatory bodies hence, there is prevalent confusion in its definition and scope. Currently, it is being classified as either a subclass of a cosmetic or drug. In Europe and Japan, cosmeceuticals are categorized under cosmetics; however, in the US, cosmeceuticals are considered to be a subclass of drugs.
            <br>
            <br>
            The scope of cosmeceuticals has exponentially been expanding and this encompasses products for both veterinary and human use. Examples of veterinary cosmeceuticals include shampoos and anti-ectoparasites, while cosmeceuticals for humans include alpha-hydroxy acids for exfoliation and skin rejuvenation and topical vitamin C. Commonly, human cosmeceuticals are used for, but not limited to, the following:
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>skin lightening or depigmentation</li>

            <li>sun protection</li>

            <li>moisturization</li>

            <li>anti-wrinkle/ anti-aging effects</li>

            <li>scar reduction</li>

            <li>antioxidant effects</li>

            <li>hair strengthening/ hair fall arrest/ hair growth stimulation/ textural hair improvement</li>

            <li>treatment of specific disorders (e.g., acne, rosacea, melisma)</li>

            <li>miscellaneous uses</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            Deficiency in regulatory nomenclature of cosmeceuticals holds an impact which can cause far-reaching consequences concerning the essentials of product labeling, the stringency of testing protocol, and approval for sale and distribution.
            <br>
            <br>
            Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), a cosmeceutical is identified as a drug, a cosmetic, or a combination of both, but its term has no meaning under the law. Distinctively, the FD&C Act defines drugs and cosmetics as the following, respectively:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="pl-4"><em>
            “Drugs, in part, are defined by their intended use, as ‘articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease’ and ‘articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals’ [FD&C Act, sec. 201(g)(1)].”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Cosmetic are defined by their intended use, and are ‘articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body...for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance’ [FD&C Act, sec. 201(i)]. Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and facial makeup preparations, cleansing shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, and deodorants, as well as any substance intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product.”
            </em></div>
            <br>
            In contrast to drug products requiring premarket approval from FDA prior to it being made available to the consumers, cosmetic products and ingredients, with the exception of color additives, do not require FDA approval before they go on the market.
            <br>
            <br>
            Even when regulations and processes relating to cosmetics are less complex, as per Good Clinical Practices (GCP), clinical studies with adequate power should be essential to demonstrate the intended activity of the cosmeceutical for treatment of the particular minor skin disorder or \'condition\', and there must be an assurance that safety requirements are optimal and that there are no expected side effects.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for cosmetics are guidelines provided, but not regulated, by the FDA which play a significant factor in ensuring that the cosmetic products are neither adulterated nor misbranded. This is in contrast to drugs which by law requires strict adherence to GMP requirements, and there are regulations specifying minimum current GMP requirements for drugs [Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211]. Failure to follow GMP requirements causes a drug to be adulterated [FD&C Act, sec. 501(a)(2)(B)].

                 Consumer goods are tangible final goods which are produced or manufactured for consumption by individuals in the mass market. Fast moving consumer good (FMCG), also called repeat-purchase packaged good, refers to non-durable goods required for daily or frequent use by the consumers.
                <br><br>
                FMCGs are essential goods manufactured, distributed and marketed with a relatively lower price, and are sold with a quick turnover rate. Examples of these good are, but not limited to, the following:
                <ul>
                <li>toiletries</li>

                <li>soap</li>

                <li>cosmetics</li>

                <li>tooth cleaning products</li>

                <li>plastic goods</li>

                <li>consumer electronics</li>

                <li>packaged food products</li>

                <li>soft drinks</li>
                </ul>

                Generally, several factors affect the frequency and the type of good that a consumer purchases. These may include the following scenarios:
                <br>
                <br>

                <ol>
                <li>Income variability – Low-income household tend to buy certain products more frequently as a consequence to lack of liquidity and storage space in comparison to high-income household that can afford to buy the same product, in large volumes or in bulks, more infrequently.</li>

                <li>Cultural difference – In western countries, the practice of buying and stocking foods for relatively longer period of time is more prevalent in sharp contrast with other countries which prefer fresh food articles, hence purchasing at small quantities more frequently.</li>
                </ol>
                Nonetheless, FMCGs are extremely important since these are primarily essential products which make the dominant part of the consumer’s demand. To cater to these demands, there is a need for constant supply in the market.

                <p>The food and beverage industry comprises companies that are involved in the process/ manufacture of raw food materials, packaging, and distribution of their finished goods. It is inclusive of fresh, prepared foods and packaged ones, as well as various kinds of beverages (alcoholic or non-alcoholic). Any product meant for human consumption, aside from pharmaceuticals, is considered to be under this industry.
                <br><br>
                Since these goods are meant to be consumed by humans, safety and quality of these products must be embedded in the entire manufacturing process. This is achieved by strict adherence to industrial protocols and guidelines together with effective manufacturing processing techniques, and use of primary engineering controls (PECs) and secondary engineering controls (SECs).
                <br><br>

                Current food good manufacturing practices (cGMP’s), Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 110 (21 CFR 110), contains description of methods, equipment, facilities, and controls for producing processed food. This regulation specifies the industry\'s requirements on appropriate personal hygienic practices, design and construction of a food plant and maintenance of plant grounds, plant equipment, sanitary operations, facility sanitation, and production and process controls.
                <br><br>

                cGMP serves as basis for FDA inspections as part of the overall regulatory control over the safety of the nation\'s food supply.

                Esco Pharma with its wide range of innovative and turnkey solutions, enables various pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, and food and beverage industries to comply with the internationally accredited GMP, as well as, industrial, environmental, and health and safety standards.  </p>

                The function of colorants on various pharmaceutical dosage forms usually consist of various reasons: (1) to enhance aesthetic appearance hence sometimes referred to as cosmetics for pharmaceutical preparations; (2) to impart distinct appearance for easy identification of a particular formulation thereby decreasing dispensing/medication errors; (3) to increase patient acceptability of medications especially for children; and (4) to prolong stability by providing opacity to protect light-sensitive active materials in the formulation.

                <li><strong>Inorganic colors or mineral colors</strong>
                <br><br>
                Inorganic colors or mineral colors offer great advantage with their opacifying capabilities (e.g., Titanium dioxide) which enhances formulation or drug stability towards light. Although there is only a limited selection of colors, these colorants are preferred due to their wide regulatory acceptance.
                <br><br>

                Significant applications of inorganic/mineral colors to pharmaceuticals include mixture of red and yellow ferric oxides to give calamine a flesh color, and use of Titanium dioxide to color and opacify hard gelatin capsules.
                <br><br></li>

                <li><strong>Natural colors or vegetable and animal colors</strong>
                <br><br>

                Natural colors or vegetable and animal colors is a chemically and physically diverse group of materials. Some colors are products of chemical synthesis (e.g., β‐carotene) rather than extraction from a natural source, and the term “natural” refers to “nature identical” and is used more descriptively. In general, although natural colors are not stable to light as compared to other groups of colors, they are advantageous due to their wide acceptability.
                <br><br>

                In application to medicaments and pharmaceuticals, only few vegetable extracts have acceptable colors of their own. In the past, large number of colorants of vegetable origin were used, but presently only three (3) are left in the codex: caramel (formerly called burnt sugar), cochineal (a dried insect), and carmine (the aluminum lake of the coloring matter of cochineal). Other examples of natural colorants include the following:
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <ul>
                    <li>Riboflavin and Anthocyanins</li>

                    <li>Paprika Oleoresin</li>

                    <li>Beet Root Red</li>

                    <li>Curcumin (Turmeric)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
                Colorants hold an almost unique status as pharmaceutical excipients such that most regulatory agencies of the world hold positive lists of colors allowed to be used on medicinal products. Purity of the individual coloring agent is also defined by legislation. In many regions around the world, distinction of colors to be used for drug and food are distinguished.
                <br><br>
                As per the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, three categories  of coal tar dyes were created, of which only the first two are applicable to the manufacture of chewable tablets.
                <br>
                <br>

                <ul>

                <li>FD&C colors: These are colorants that are certifiable for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.</li>

                <li>D&C colors: These are  dyes  and pigments  considered safe  for use  in  drugs  and   cosmetics  when  in  contact  with  mucous membranes or when ingested.</li>

                <li>External D&C colors: These   colorants are only considered safe for external use due to   their oral toxicity, hence not certifiable for use in products intended for ingestion.</li>


                </ul>

                Pharmaceutical colorants are diverse, and consultation on the safety and handling data from the manufacturers’ data sheets must be done for specific colors.
                <br><br>
                In  general,  inorganic pigments  and  lakes  possess a relatively  low hazard,  and depending on the complexity of the process and the quantity of materials being handled, standard  chemical  handling  precautions should be observed. Special care must also be taken in preventing excessive dust generation and inhalation of dust. On the other hand, organic dyes,  natural  colors,  and  nature‐identical colors  present  a  relatively greater  hazard  and  appropriate precautions should accordingly be taken.
                <br><br>
                In addition, observance on guidelines set by FDA on the current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) applicable to drug, food and cosmetics must be practiced in order to ensure that products being processed are maintained to be of safe and high quality, and are not adulterated.
                <br><br>
                Esco offers a wide range of products that allows safe and efficient handling/ compounding of materials that may pose health hazard risks. Examples of these include Isolators and <strong><a href="/products/ventilated-balance-enclosure/29">Ventilated Balance Enclosures.</a></strong>

The major concerns for company marketing nutraceuticals are to separate and purify the functional constituents for the production of ingredients and/or supplements, improve the bioavailability of the isolated nutrients (through adequate handling/processing) and improve nutrient retention during processing to ensure safety of fortified foods. Handling of nutraceuticals requires isolators, downflow booths, biological refrigerators and ovens.',
            'content' => '
                <p>
                The term ‘Nutraceuticals’ was invented in 1989 by Stephen DeFelice, and is a hybrid of ‘nutrients’ and ‘pharmaceuticals’. This consists of products which are more than food due to their expected health/medicinal benefits but less than pharmaceuticals because of their unproven physiological actions. To date, there is still no internationally agreed definition for these products, and how they are judged varies from country to country.
                <br><br>
                Plenty of ingredients are found in food but people need more ingredients and more health effects that one can expect from changes in eating habits. Due to public demand, products containing concentrated nutrient-ingredients such as nutraceuticals appeared. As cited in the book titled, ‘The Role of Functional Food Security in Global Health’ by Tellesy in 2019, it is said that 50-70% of the population in developed countries use nutraceuticals, and this number is increasing by the age.
                <br><br>

                Wide range of ingredients and products are covered by nutraceuticals. In some cases, these ingredients are also found in registered pharmaceuticals and nutrition supplements as well. Examples of these include:
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Probiotics</li>

                <li>Omega-3 fatty acids</li>

                <li>Glucosamine</li>

                <li>Melatonin</li>

                <li>Lutein</li>

                <li>Vitamins</li>

                <li>Minerals</li>
                </ul>

                The form of these concentrated nutrients were similar, and later identical to pharmaceutical dosage forms, and for this reason, majority of the consumers are unable to differentiate between OTC pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements, phytotherapeutic products (herbal medicines), natural health products, or nutraceuticals.
                <br><br>
                From a safety point of view, usually nutraceuticals are trusted products even without the approval from health authorities unlike pharmaceuticals. A lot of clinical studies are carried out, and results originating from these trials support their effectiveness as well as their general safety. However, these products may present risk if they were to be used without any medical control as there are potential interactions with medications which can be harmful, especially to those considered to be vulnerable (e.g., old, young, chronically sick) in the population.
                <br><br>
                Usually, approval processes are not carried out due to economic reasons hence, the quality of the product documentation doesn’t reach the acceptance level of the authorities. Even without approval, nutraceuticals are expected to perform benefits/effects similar to pharmaceuticals, and this similarity and reliability depends on the manufacturer.
                <br><br>
                The quality, safety and effectiveness of nutraceuticals are heavily dependent on the manufacturers, thus facility/ process integrity are critical in ensuring an efficient and reliable production flow to get the desired product.
                <br><br>
                Esco offers a wide range of products that facilitates in the efficient processing of nutraceuticals. Examples of these include Isolators and <strong><a href="/products/ventilated-balance-enclosure/29">Ventilated Balance Enclosures</a></strong>.

                According to the Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary of 1972, the term electronics is defined as “The science and technology of the conduction of electricity in a vacuum, a gas, or a semiconductor, and devices based thereon.”
                <br><br>
                While it is difficult to predict how old electronics are, in observance with the present times in the 21st century, the impact of electronics show significance in making the daily life easy and comfortable. Examples of developments in the electronics industry include: radios, televisions, electronic versions of newspapers, social networking sites, e-mail, e-commerce, and e-governance. All of these have their own contributions, and most are applied for entertainment and/or for the purpose of information dissemination.
                <br><br>
                In our daily lives, other electronic devices which are widely used are encompassing of vast applications i.e. computers, information technology, consumer electronics, healthcare, sensing, automotive applications, communication systems.
                <br><br>
                For early versions of electronic devices, the vacuum tube was used as the fundamental technology of the industry which was later on superseded by semiconductor components. Although the electronics industry consists of various areas, the semiconductor sector is the central driving force behind and of the entire industry.
                <br><br>
                Invented and pioneered in the United States shortly after World War II, semiconductors are used to fabricate electronic devices, and enable technology of the information age. Semiconductors are tiny electronic devices, usually smaller than a postage stamp, consisting of billions of components that store, move and process data. These functions are enabled through semiconducting materials such as silicon and germanium which provide data processing capabilities in millions of products (e.g., coffee pots, space vehicles), and allow precise control of the flow of electrical current.
                <br><br>
                Semiconductors (sometimes referred to as chip), in application, are used to run software applications (e.g., email, internet browsers, word/ spreadsheet processing programs). These also function as the brain with memory and data communication capabilities for various devices such as cellphones, gaming systems, aircraft, military equipment, and weapons. Hence, many products with roots in the mechanical system are heavily dependent on chip-based electronics.

                Generally, major wars are rare and its variability in time and geographical scope are hard to predict. Many countries allot substantial resources to invest on the procurement, maintenance and training of armies in order to deter a war and, if necessary, be prepared for major attacks against them. Defense industries have become an integral part of a nation’s security.

                <strong>On a cleanroom paradigm</strong>
                <br><br>
                During war, increase in reliance on electronic equipment (e.g., radar, proximity fuse, portable radio) result in the need for miniaturization of mechanical devices and systems, and electrical, electronic, and electromechanical systems as well.
                <br><br>
                Wartime efforts to fit increasingly complex devices and systems in small spaces, such as in aircrafts and missiles, have brought new requirements to approach the downscale of size while maintaining high reliability.
                <br><br>
                Military applications were one of the main driving forces for the invention of semiconductors. Semiconductors, also known as chips, are tiny electronic devices consisting of billions of components which store, move, and process data. These provide the “brains”, memory, and data capabilities of various products ranging from cellphones, aircrafts to military equipment and weapons.
                <br><br>
                For military equipment and weapons, semiconductors are used in many defense-related components (e.g., computers, sensors, switches, amplifiers). According to an analyst as cited in the article of Gain, B. in 2003, electronic contents/components are increasing in military ordinance, fighter planes, bombers, tanks, armored personal carriers, and a range of other weapon systems.
                <br><br>
                Miniaturization was one of the primary drivers for the need of contamination control in the industry. Along with this, the production of semiconductors involve a relatively extreme complex manufacturing process as it is small and densely packed with transistors. Fabrication of semiconductors consist of multiple steps to create integrated circuits, including microprocessors, memory, and microcontrollers. The entire process at an average last for six to eight weeks and is performed in fabrication plans that require clean rooms.

                <strong>On a containment paradigm</strong>
                <br><br>
                Nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are considered as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) due to its capability of causing massive and indiscriminate destruction of the environment and human beings.
                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">
                <li><strong>Chemical Weapons</strong>
                <br>
                Usage of toxic substances as weapons is dated to have been practiced since several thousands of years ago. It is associated with traditional methods of hunting which include: use of poisoned weapons (e.g., arrows, spears), poisoning of water (watering holes/ fishing), and fumigation of animals with toxic combustion products.
                <br><br>
                All of which are hunting forms that have appeared in combat and have later particularly developed for ancient wars, and have persisted until the present time.
                <br><br>
                Of the three WMD, chemical weapons (CW), by far, have been the most widely used stockpiled weapons, and their biochemical properties are used to debilitate or kill people, animals, and plants. Effects of CW to human beings include the following:
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Exogenous irritation (i.e., skin and eyes)</li>

                <li>Endogenous irritation (i.e., lungs)</li>

                <li>Suffocation</li>

                <li>Collapse of nervous system</li>

                <li>Disruption of oxygen flow throughout the body</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Biological Weapons</strong>

                Biological weapons (BW) are among the oldest weapons used through history of mankind. Of the three WMD, BWs are considered to be the deadliest in relation to the amount needed for it to cause widespread suffering and death. Most of the well-known forms of BW (e.g., anthrax, typhus, smallpox) are derived from bacteria, viruses, biological toxins, or fungi.
                <br>
                <br>

                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Nuclear Weapons</strong>
                <br>

                In consideration to the destructive potential of the explosion, along with the extreme heat, the nuclear fallout generated, and the serious long-term health consequences they cause, nuclear weapons are the most extreme form of WMD
                <br><br>
                Nuclear weapons can be derived from nuclear fission, or a combination of fission and fusion (the latter called a thermonuclear weapon). This involves a process where a sufficient amount of fissile material (e.g., highly enriched uranium or plutonium) is required to start a nuclear chain reaction.

                <p>The automotive industry encompasses companies and activities involving manufacture of motor vehicles which include components such as engines and bodies, excluding tires, batteries, and fuel. The principal products of this industry are passenger automobiles and light trucks, including pickups, vans, as well as sports utility vehicles.
                <br><br>
                The automotive industry has been growing fast and its technical development had inquired special classes for technical cleanliness. Cleanliness is vital as the tolerances of the assemblies built into vehicles become lower, and their parts also compiled to support relatively higher stress, therefore making them more sensitive to particle contamination. Example is of a chip that is only a few microns length, this has the capacity to compromise or even cause failure to an entire complex hydraulic system.
                <br><br>

                To ensure quality, safety and reliability, it is important to have a control/function area which is free of critical impurities coming from the production process and environment. To further prevent contamination, standardizing the environmental production can be done and this involves, but is not limited to, the following:
                <br>
                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">

                The space industry is deemed vast and is understood as the economic sector which provides space-related goods and services. Specifically, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Global Forum on Space Economics defines space economy as:
                </p>
                <div class="px-5"><em>“All public and private actors involved in developing and providing space-enabled products and services. It comprises a long value-added chain, starting with research and development actors and manufacturers of space hardware (e.g. launch vehicles, satellites, ground stations) and ending with the providers of space-enabled products (e.g. navigation equipment, satellite phones) and services (e.g. satellite-based meteorological services or direct-to-home video services) to final users.”</em></div><br>
                <p>
                Space applications hold significant importance in the everyday life as utilization of space and satellite technologies enable weather forecasting, air traffic control, global communications and broadcasting, disaster management, etc.
                <br><br>
                The space economy has evolved from the aerospace industry, and to date, the two still share various aspects, components as well as technologies (e.g., space launchers being modified guided missiles).
                <br><br>

                The aerospace industry encompasses the manufacture of wide ranging aircraft and spacecraft products, and space-related items such as the following:
                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">
                <li>Passenger military aeroplanes</li>

                <li>Helicopters</li>

                <li>Gliders</li>

                <li>Spacecraft</li>

                <li>Launch vehicles</li>

                <li>Satellites</li>
                </ul>

                Cleanrooms were initially developed for aerospace applications to facilitate in the manufacture and assembly of gyroscopes, precision ball bearings, satellites and aerospace electronics. This is because even a miniscule amount of contaminants can degrade the performance of the spacecraft hardware hence contamination control is vital for the success of most aerospace programs.
                <br><br>

                The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) define cleanrooms as:
                <br>
                </p>
                <div class="px-5"><em>“Areas in which particle concentration and environmental conditions are controlled within specified limits. The limits of the particle concentrations are normally set by the requirements of the process occurring within the space so that contamination of people, processes and equipment can be mitigated.”</em></div>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">The effective dose caused to a worker by radiation work shall not exceed an average of 20 milliieverts (mSv) per year reckoned over a period of five years, nor 50 mSv in any one year. The annual equivalent dose in the lens of the eye shall not exceed 150 mSv, nor shall the annual equivalent dose at any point on the hands, feet or skin exceed 500 mSv.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to keep individual radiation exposures low, additional dose constraints lower than the above mentioned shall be used at the nuclear facility. Annual doses over 20 mSv can be accepted only in justified exceptions.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The effective dose to a young person of no less than 16 but no more than 18 years of age who is involved in the use of radiation sources in the course of vocational training shall not exceed 6 mSv per year. The annual equivalent dose in the lens of the eye shall not exceed 50 mSv, nor shall the annual equivalent dose at any point on the hands, feet or skin exceed 150 mSv.</p>
                <p><img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 448px; height: 298px;" class="my-3" src="/images/upload/nuclear_med_img2.jpg"></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">When applying the maximum values for radiation exposure, no allowance shall be made for exposure arising from immediate measures necessary to limit the radiation hazard resulting from an accident and to bring a radiation source under control. These measures shall be arranged so that the radiation exposure resulting from the situation is limited to the least possible.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">If the radiation exposure resulting from measures referred to in paragraph 1 may exceed any of the dose limits prescribed in Section 3, then the measures shall be performed on a voluntary basis. The persons performing the measures shall be advised of the hazard pertaining to the said measures.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Except where the matter concerns the saving of human lives, the effective dose of a person involved in the measures referred to in this Section shall not exceed 0.5 Sv and the equivalent dose at any point on the skin shall not exceed 5 Sv.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Radiation protection at nuclear facilities shall be based on good planning of activities, ap&shy;propriate working methods, up-to-date radiation protection methods, instruments and protective equipment, utilisation of prior experience as well as co-operation between the different organisati&shy;on units within the nuclear facility. Commitment to the implementation of radiation protection concerns the whole staff of the nuclear facility.</p>

                <li><strong>Zones of controlled area</strong></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The premises of the controlled area shall be divi&shy;ded into zones based on external dose rate, sur&shy;face contamination and concentration of airborne activity. There shall be at least three zones.</p>
                <p>The following conditions shall be fulfilled in the premises of the lowest zone:</p>
                <ul class="listMe">
                    <li>external dose rate ≤ 25 μSv/h</li>
                    <li>surface contamination: beta emitters ≤ 4 Bq/cm2 alpha emitters ≤ 0,4 Bq/cm<sup>2</sup></li>
                    <li>concentration of airborne activity ≤ 0,3 DAC (Derived Air Concentration).</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">The highest zone consists of premises where only short-term, beforehand carefully planned stays are allowed. At least those premises, where one of the following conditions is fulfilled, belong to this zone:</p>
                <ul class="listMe">
                    <li>external dose rate ≥ 1 mSv/h</li>
                    <li>surface contamination: beta emitters ≥ 40 Bq/cm2 alpha emitters ≥ 4 Bq/cm2</li>
                    <li>concentration of airborne activity ≥ 30 DAC.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">External dose rate, surface contamination or con&shy;centration of airborne activity may locally exceed the classification limit if the sub-area in question is separated by access barriers and marked with signs indicating the radiation situation, poten&shy;tial stay limitations and protective equipment required. Exceptional radiation sources shall be always visibly marked.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The zone classification of an area and the grounds for it shall be clearly indicated with signs at the entrance. If the radiation situa&shy;tion of an area changes, the sign indicating the area’s classification shall be changed without delay to correspond with the new conditions.</p>


                <li><strong>Movement in Controlled Area</strong></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The access to the controlled area shall be moni&shy;tored. Premises except those of the lowest zone shall be locked up or monitored. Persons moving in the controlled area shall have a personal badge visible for identification and access right checking. Persons working in the area shall al&shy;ways have a personal dose meter (dosimeter). If the individual radiation dose received in a workplace may exceed 0,5 mSv per week, a dosi&shy;meter enabling real-time dose monitoring shall be additionally used. An alarming dosimeter (preferably with a dose rate alarm) shall be used if the dose rate may exceed 1 mSv per hour.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Radiation dose of visitors in the controlled area shall be measured. Group dosimeters may be used if the radiation dose measured is repre&shy;sentative considering all individuals in a group.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">At least protective overalls and shoe covers shall be used as protective clothing, comple&shy;mented by necessary additional protective gear (protective gloves and shoes, respirators) requi&shy;red in the task. Protective overalls may be rep&shy;laced by protective coats in justified exceptions if the contamination risk of clothes is low.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 435px; height: 326px;" class="my-3" src="/images/upload/nuclear_med_img4.jpg"></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Eating, drinking and smoking are prohibited in the controlled area. Exceptions to this rule may be separately allocated cafeterias and break areas. In addition, an exception may be the use of water dispensers. However, these premises and dispensers may be used only under the supervisi&shy;on of the radiation protection personnel if it can be ensured by radiation measurements that their use will not cause any internal contamination to workers.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Hands and protective clothing of the person&shy;nel leaving the controlled area shall be checked with a measuring instrument for surface con&shy;tamination. The area can be exited normally if the contamination limits of a worker are not exceeded. Measurement results ex&shy;ceeding the surface contamination limit shall be recorded. For the cleanup of the surface contami&shy;nation of workers, the nuclear facility shall have appropriately equipped premises for the deconta&shy;mination of individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">If it can be suspected based on the surface contamination measurements that a worker has received internal contamination, an immediate on-site measurement by using an internal radia&shy;tion monitoring equipment shall be conducted.</p>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="mt-3">Radiation Work Permit</h4>
                <ul class="listMe">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">A radiation work permit is needed for radiation work conducted in the controlled area. A perma&shy;nent permit may be issued for routine and repe&shy;titive tasks. The methods and responsibilities for issuing of the radiation work permit shall be defined in the radiation protection procedures of the facility.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The radiation work permit or related docu&shy;ments shall include at least</p>
                <ul class="listMe">
                    <li>author and acceptor of the permit</li>
                    <li>date of granting</li>
                    <li>names of workers (or supervisor and head&shy;count)</li>
                    <li>task and radiation conditions in the workpla&shy;ce</li>

                    <li>safety instructions and protective equipment</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The radiation work permit shall be visible at the workplace. The radiation protection per&shy;sonnel shall have the right and responsibility to inspect that the work performed in the workplace complies with the permit. Based on the monitoring of radiation work permits and work, records shall be kept of work which has caused significant radiation doses.</p>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="mt-3">Radiation Protection Training</h4>
                <ul class="listMe">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The aim of radiation protection training is to provide workers with preconditions for correct working in the controlled and supervised areas, prohibit unnecessary radiation exposure and in&shy;fluence to the accomplishment of the radiation protection goals. In addition, training shall give preconditions to act consistently if unpredictable situations occur at the workplace. As far as pos&shy;sible, work phases shall also be trained before they are performed in demanding workplaces as regards radiation protection.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Training provided to personnel working in the controlled area shall at least include the appli&shy;cable parts of the radiation legislation and re&shy;gulations issued by virtue of it, fundamentals of radiation and radiological risks, instructions for working in the controlled area as well as infor&shy;mation on the monitoring of radiation exposure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Training shall be given to all permanent and temporary workers of the nuclear facility wor&shy;king in the controlled area. In addition, specific radiation protection training shall be given to those persons whose work (e.g. work planning) affects significantly to the results of radiation protection.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In connection with giving training and instruc&shy;tions the worker’s responsibility for taking care of his/her own and other persons’ radiation safety shall be highlighted.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Radiation protection training at nuclear faci&shy;lities shall be given to both domestic and foreign workers to an adequate extent.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Workers shall demonstrate the adequacy of their radiation safety knowledge in a written exam. A record shall be prepared of the exam, indicating the name of the worker who performed the exam and the name of the employer who evaluated it.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Radiation protection training shall be given already before the commissioning of the facili&shy;ty. In addition to the initial training, refresher training shall be organised at regular intervals. Radiation protection training can be considered to be qualified for both Finnish nuclear power plants, if the plant specific characteristics and differences have been taken into account in con&shy;nection with training. For example, it is sufficient that written material is handed out to workers. On the same basis, radiation protection trai&shy;ning in Sweden can also be approved at Finnish nuclear power plants.</p>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="mt-3">Pre clinical</strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Preclinical in vitro and in vivo proof-of-concept, pharmacology, and toxicology studies are conducted to establish feasibility and rationale for clinical use of the investigational cellular and gene therapy cellular and gene therapy (CGT) product, as well as to characterize the product’s safety profile. These studies also serve as the scientific basis to support the conclusion that it is reasonably safe to conduct the proposed clinical investigations. Due to the diversity of CGT products, it is important to conduct a careful benefit-risk analysis, performed in the context of the particular clinical condition under study. Preclinical data derived from studies conducted in appropriate animal species and animal models of disease contribute to defining reasonable risk for the investigational CGT product.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Preclinical studies are intended to define the pharmacologic and toxicologic effects predictive of the human response, not only prior to initiation of clinical trials, but also throughout drug development. The goals of these studies include the following: to define safe starting doses and escalation schemes for clinical trials, to identify target organs for toxicity and parameters to monitor in patients receiving these therapies, and to determine populations which may be at greater risk for toxicities of a given cellular or gene therapeutic.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Design of preclinical studies should take into consideration: 1) the population of cells to be administered or the class of vector used, 2) the animal species and physiologic state most relevant for the clinical indication and product class, and 3) the intended doses, route of administration, and treatment regimens.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-3">Phase 1</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The <em>Preparation and Harvesting</em> phase of cell and gene therapy includes the acclimatization of the test animals for extraction. <a href="http://www.escoglobal.com/category/cage-changing-stations/">Animal workstations </a>are necessary for containment purposes during animal handling mainly for personnel and environment protection.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">With the introduction of the VIVA® range, Esco applies decades of experience in clean air technologies to the animal research laboratory, protecting personnel and the laboratory environment from:</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">This phase also covers up the cell collection process, hence, it is extremely important to consider the following criteria before and/or after the cell/tissue of the species have been extracted:</p>
                <ul class="listMeNumDec">
                <li><strong>Cell types:</strong> The type(s) of cell to be used should be classified as autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic in origin. The tissue source and other relevant identifying information should be provided.</li>
                <li><strong>Donor selection criteria:</strong> Any relevant characteristics of the donor(s) should be specified, including age and sex. Exclusion criteria should focus on the presence or likelihood of infection by HIV-1 and HIV-2, hepatitis B and C viruses, HTLV-1, and other infectious agents. Serological, diagnostic, and clinical history data to be obtained from donors should be specified.</li>
                <li><strong>Tissue typing:</strong> If allogeneic donors are to be used, typing for polymorphisms such as blood type should be included when appropriate. The importance of matching for histocompatibility antigens (HLA class I and/or II, and perhaps minor antigens in some cases) between donor and recipient should be addressed, and typing procedures and acceptance criteria provided.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="mt-3">Phase 2</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The transfer of genetic material can be accomplished in vivo through local or systemic inoculation or ex vivo where the target of interest is collected and modified outside of the organism before being returned to the host. Transfer of synthetic DNA can be accomplished by transduction or transfection. Such methods of transfer include either direct injection of DNA into the recipient cells, or utilization of methods to induce membranes permeabilisation, receptor-mediated uptake or endocytosis. Transduction utilizes recombinant virus as a vector for gene transfer.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">While natural transfer of genetic material can be accomplished in several ways, degradation of plasmid DNA is susceptible because of biologic enzymes, hence the following synthetic delivery systems are used:</p>
                <ul class="listMeNum">
                <li><strong>Iontophoresis</strong></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Iontophoresis is a non-invasive method of propelling high concentrations of a charged substance, normally medication or bioactive agents, transdermally by repulsive electromotive force using a small electrical charge applied to an iontophoretic chamber containing a similarly charged active agent and its vehicle.</p>
                <center><img class="my-3" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="img-responsive" alt="" src="/images/upload/cg_img5.jpg"></center>
                <li><strong>Electroporation or electropermeabilization</strong></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">This is a significant increase in the electrical conductivity and permeability of the cell plasma membrane caused by an extremely applied electrical field. It is usually used as a way of introducing some substance into a cell, such as loading with a molecular probe, a drug that can change the cell’s function, or a piece of coding DNA.</p>
                <center><img class="my-3" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="img-responsive" alt="" src="/images/upload/cg_img6.jpg"></center>
                <li><strong>Liposomes</strong></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">This is a spherical vesicle with a membrane composed of phospholipid and cholesterol bilayer. Liposomes can be composed of naturally-derived phospholipids with mixed lipid chains or of pure surfactants. To deliver the molecules to sites of action, the lipid bilayer can fuse with other bilayers such as the cell membrane, in order to deliver the liposome contents.</p>
                <center><img class="my-3" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="img-responsive" alt="" src="/images/upload/cg_img7.jpg"></center>
                <li><strong>Injector</strong></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">An injector is a pump-like device, which charges or discharges containers under pressure with suitable arrangements. Motive force is gained at the inlet from a suitable gas or liquid that is under pressure. Pneumatic injectors can deliver 10-15 L femtolitre of materials and specialized mechanical pumps are capable of 10-12 L picolitre delivery volumes.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="mt-3">Phase 3</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Scaffolds used for tissue engineering and regeneration can be synthetic polymers, naturally derived proteins/polymers, and tissue-derived scaffolds produced by decellularization. Synthetic scaffolds can be tailored and reproduced readily with controlled mechanical properties, porosity, and surface topography. However, this approach faces limitations such as uncertainties regarding the degradation rate and products as well as cell compatibility. Naturally derived proteins/polymers (e.g. collagen, fibrin, alginate) possess intrinsic cell compatibility, but they are often weak in mechanical properties and difficult to manipulate.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Decellularization, on the other hand, removes cellular components from tissues/organs to generate extracellular matrix templates, a complex mixture of structural and functional proteins that can be used for tissue engineering applications. The removal of cellular content and antigens from the tissue-derived scaffolds reduces foreign body reaction, inflammation, and potential immune rejection. Effective decellularization methods include chemical, enzymatic, physical or combinational approaches. The working principle of these methods is through disruption of cell membrane, which will then cause the cellular contents to be released and rinsed away.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Decellularization&nbsp; includes chemical methods such as the utilization of ionic detergents like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), non-ionic detergents (Triton X-100), chelating agent (EDTA), zwitterionic-based detergent, acids and bases, hypotonic and hypertonic solutions, alcohols and acetone and enzymatic method such as trypsin treatment. Physical method like scraping, solution agitation, pressure gradient, and <a href="http://www.escoglobal.com/product/cold-storage/ii-ultra-low-temperature-freezer-gold-controller/UUS-B/">freezing.</a></p>
                <center><img class="my-3" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="img-responsive" alt="" src="/images/upload/cg_img8.png"></center>
                <p>Scaffolds are sterilized afterwards, preventing contamination and potential transmission of pathogens. Sterilization involves the use of <a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/unit-operation-production-process.php?cat=sterility-testing">sterility test isolators</a> and acellular scaffolds including ethanol, peracetic acid, ethylene oxide, ultraviolet and gamma radiation. Aside from sterilization, scaffold stabilization is also used to delay degradation, neutralize antigens, and stabilize the overall structure of ECM.</p>
                <center><img class="my-3" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="img-responsive" alt="" src="/images/upload/cg_img9.png"></center>

                <p style="text-align: left;"><em>Different freeze drying applications such as preservation of biological samples, purification of proteins, and concentration of chemical products, are now done perfectly with SubliMate®.</em></p>
                <p>The following criteria should also be considered during the phase III of regenerative therapy:</p>
                <ul class="listMeNumDec">
                <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Quality control procedures:</strong> In general, cell culture operations should be carefully managed in terms of quality of materials, manufacturing controls, and equipment validation and monitoring.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Culture media:</strong> Acceptance criteria should be established for all media and components, including validation of serum additives and growth factors, as well as verification of freedom from adventitious agents. Medium components which have the potential to cause sensitization, for example certain animal sera, selected proteins, and blood group substances, should be avoided. For growth factors, measures of identity, purity, and potency should be established to assure the reproducibility of cell culture characteristics.</li>
                <center><img class="my-3" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="img-responsive" alt="" src="/images/upload/pf-img3.png"></center>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>CelCradle™ is a disposable bioreactor capable of high-density cell culture for protein expression, virus, and monoclonal antibody production. It is designed based on the concept of bellow-induced intermittent flow of media and air through porous matrices, where cells reside. This provides a low shear, high aeration, and foam-free culture environment.</em></p>
                <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Adventitious agents in cell cultures:</strong> Documentation should be provided as proof that cells are being handled, propagated, and subjected to laboratory procedures under conditions designed to minimize contamination with adventitious agents. During long term culturing, cells should be tested periodically for contamination. Testing should ensure that cells are free of bacteria, yeast, mold, mycoplasma, and adventitious viruses.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Monitoring of cell identity and heterogeneity:</strong> Both manufacturing and testing procedures should be implemented to ensure the control of cell cultures with regard to identity and heterogeneity.</li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Cell culturing practices and facilities should be designed to avoid contamination of one cell culture with another.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">During cell culturing, extensive drift in the properties of a cell population, or overgrowth by a different cell type originally present in low numbers, may occur. To detect such changes, cell identity should be assessed quantitatively, for example, by monitoring cell surface antigens or biochemical markers. The method of identification chosen should also be able to detect contamination or replacement by other cells in use in the facility. Acceptable limits for culture composition should be defined. Quantitative assays of functional potency may sometimes provide a method for population phenotyping. The desired function should be monitored when the cells are subjected to manipulation, and the tests carried out periodically to assure that the desired trait is retained. Identity testing should, in some cases, include verification of donor-recipient matching and immunological phenotyping.</p>
                <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Characterization of therapeutic entity:</strong> If the intended therapeutic effect is based on a particular molecular species synthesized by the cells, enough structural and biological information should be provided to show that an appropriate and biologically active form is present.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Culture longevity:</strong> The essential characteristics of the cultured cell population (phenotypic markers such as cell surface antigens, functional properties, activity in bioassays, as appropriate) should be defined, and the stability of these characteristics established with respect to time in culture. This profile should be used to define the limits of the culture period.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4 class="mt-3">Phase 4</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The major progress in microsystem technologies for creating small, integrated and reliable microtransducers devices in combination with biological sensing elements has revolutionized the field of biosensors during the last decade. Such micro-biosensor systems raised the expectation to get a comprehensive insight into dynamic cellular metabolic events and subsequently a complete understanding of the metabolism of human biology.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-3">Quality Control of Regenerative Drug Products</h4>
                <ul class="listMeNum">
                <li><strong>Risk and Sterility</strong></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Two different critical factors govern the aseptic processing of aseptic drugs involving cell/gene therapy.&nbsp; The first of these is “risk evaluation/analysis”, the goal of which is risk quantification. The other is “risk mitigation” that considers the possibility of contamination during facility design, equipment selection, definition of process, and the operation of the process itself. Risk mitigation can both indicate the level of need for process improvement and determine the priority that should be assigned to mitigation activities. Risk mitigation as it relates to <a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/unit-operation-production-process.php?cat=aseptic-pharmaceutical-manufacturing">aseptic processing</a> generally means to properly control human intervention, but ultimately if risk mitigation is to be maximized, personnel must be completely removed from critical area of aseptic processing, or sterility test isolators should be utilized.</p>
                <li><strong>Effectiveness of Gown</strong></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">It has continually been assumed by some scientists and engineers that aseptic conditions can adequately be maintained if the personnel conducting aseptic processing wear aseptic gowns properly and exhibit sound aseptic technique in conducting their work. However, it is clear from published research data that personnel emit very high levels of microbiological contamination into the environment. This is true even when state-of-the-art gowns are chosen and worn properly. According to Ljungqvist et al., personnel wearing previously unused sterilized gowns emit 1500–3000 cfu/h of microbiological contamination even during processes involving limited operations.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The microbiological contamination released by personnel can increase to ≥10,000 cfu/h during complex operations that require the execution of many physical tasks.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The total number of aerobic bacteria existing on human skin is normally &gt;1.2 million per square meter. The number of microorganisms existing on a healthy human’s hands and arms are in the range 0.9–3 million per square meter. Microorganisms are emitted by gowned personnel by a pumping effect of the technician’s gown during operation. Hence, advanced aseptic processing technologies such as <a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/news/64">Blow-Fill Seal</a> and <a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/products/closed-restrictive-access-barriers">Restricted Access Barrier System</a> on top of isolators (<a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/product.php?cat=streamline-compounding-caci">Compounding Aseptic Containment Isolator</a> and <a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/product.php?cat=streamline-compounding-cai">Compounding Aseptic Isolator</a>) are used to reduce the possibility of product contamination caused by personnel.</p>
                <center><img class="my-3" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="img-responsive" alt="" src="/images/upload/RABS.png"></center>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The closed RABS is an intermediate solution between isolators and open RABS. A closed operation RABS provides a higher level of contamination control because the RABS’ barrier doors remain closed from the point of the last bio-decontamination, through the initial set-up and processing. These systems typically use transfer systems which are similar to isolator type transfer systems that are closed and dock with the RABS.</em></p>
                <li><strong>Isolator Technology for Gene/Cell Therapy</strong></li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Isolator systems do not allow direct interventions by personnel into the enclosure’s aseptic processing area. To ensure that contamination is not introduced into the isolator, it is critical to have means of bringing the materials into and out of the isolator in a way that doesn’t compromise and allow leakage of contaminants within the enclosure. The sterility assurance provided by an isolator is a product of physical separation of personnel, elimination of risk of introduction of airborne contamination, and systems that prevent the introduction of non-sterile materials into the isolator. Safe, contamination free transfer of materials into and out of the isolator can be assured by the use of devices known as decontamination pass boxes and circular-shaped rapid transfer ports (RTP); decontamination interfaces have also been developed for isolators.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Large volumes of air are required to properly satisfy the international standards for cleanroom air. <strong><em>Air handling systems</em></strong> such as isolators and the build and design of the <a href="http://tapestlerx.com/services">cleanroom</a> is critical as these will edict the permitted processes during the sterile compounding.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">ISO Class 5/Grade A environments are required for the critical area of aseptic processing. The critical area in aseptic processing is defined as the part of a facility where product and sterilized components are brought together and filled and/or assembled. It is necessary to install and operate this ISO Class 5/Grade A critical zone environment within an ISO Class 7/Grade B environment. Equally important to this is the provision of proper gowning and support facilities to ensure safe, contaminant-free personnel and component entry. Alternatively, in some modern facilities, the entire aseptic processing room can be designed to ISO Class 5/Grade A requirements; however, such a facility is both expensive to build and operate.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The facility and the utility requirements are the fundamental support of the process flow and production effectiveness. In facility design, it is important to consider the regulatory nature of the industry and to seek some in-depth knowledge of the requirements, hence, serving the most basic foundation for a safe, effective, and pure drugs while maintaining its cost-effectiveness.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Cleanrooms are extremely critical on the manufacturing of biologics, hence the use of Cross <a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/product.php?cat=cross-contamination-facility-integrated-barrier">Contamination Facility Integrated Barrier (CCFIB)</a> can be used to maximize the performance given by a cleanroom to ensure the integrity and quality of any drug product.&nbsp;&nbsp; This equipment will minimize the exposure of chemical or biological contaminants, such as micro-organisms or adventitious agents, thus providing utmost protection to the product, operator and the environment.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/products/closed-restrictive-access-barriers">RABS</a> and isolators can be used in the manufacture of biologics, including vaccines, gene therapies, and protein-based drugs. Often, biologic products are preservative-free, contain growth media, and are easily susceptible to contamination. Another area that demands the use of <a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/products/closed-restrictive-access-barriers">RABS</a> and isolators is the manufacture of sterile drug products with toxic, cytotoxic, and highly potent molecules, which require stringent barriers to protect personnel who are handling these materials. In general, <a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/products/closed-restrictive-access-barriers">RABS</a> and isolators are being used for smaller-volume and high-value pharmaceuticals. The benefit/cost balance has to be considered when discussing the use of barriers: <a href="http://www.escopharma.com/page/products/closed-restrictive-access-barriers">RABS</a> and isolators come with a high price tag and are associated with additional expenses related to the operation of a cleanroom, such as energy costs, operating costs, testing costs, and gown costs.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Additional cGMP requirements are also included for the commercial production and delivery of these products. These requirements are but not limited to: cleanliness, validation and commissioning, process-material personnel and air flows, <a href="http://www.escoglobal.com/cold-storage.php">cold storage</a>, dry storage, emergency procedures, safety, security, pest control, environmental monitoring, and preventive maintenance.</p>

                    <p>Antibiotics, also called antibacterials are a type of antimicrobial drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infection. They either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics may have several mechanisms of action, including inhibiting cell wall synthesis, increasing cell membrane permeability, and interfering with protein synthesis, nucleic acid metabolism, and other metabolic processes (e.g. folic acid synthesis).</p>

                    <p><strong>Beta-lactam antibiotics</strong>, including penicillins and non-penicillin classes, share a basic chemical structure that includes a three-carbon, one-nitrogen cyclic amine structure known as the beta-lactam ring. Nearly all of these antibiotics prevent bacteria from constructing a cell wall by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which are enzymes inside bacterial cells involved in the final stages in the synthesis of peptidoglycan.</p>

                    <p>Drugs containing the lactam functional group are among those prone to hydrolysis. Modification of chemical structure may be used to retard hydrolysis. As it is only a fraction of the drug in a solution that hydrolyzes, a compound may be stabilized by reducing its solubility. It is for this reason that penicillin powder, reconstituted in water, given as an injection, has a citric acid citrate buffer system.</p>

                    <p>Beta-lactam antibiotics include the following classes:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Penicillins (e.g. ampiciilin, oxacillin)</li>
                        <li>Cephalosporins (e.g. cephalexin, cefaclor)</li>
                        <li>Carbapenems (e.g. imipenem, meropenem)</li>
                        <li>Carbacephems (e.g. loracarbef)</li>
                        <li>Monobactams (e.g. aztreonam)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Non beta-lactam antibiotics</strong> are used as alternatives to beta lactam antibiotics.</p>

                    <p>The following are examples of non beta-lactam antibiotics:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin)</li>
                        <li>Aminoglycosides (e.g. amikacin)</li>
                        <li>Macrolides (e.g. azithromycin)</li>
                        <li>Sulfonamides (e.g. sulfadiazine)</li>
                        <li>Tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline)</li>
                        <li>Lincosamides (e.g. lincomycin)</li>
                        <li>Miscellaneous (e.g. chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>There should be a separate manufacturing facility for beta-lactam and non beta-lactam products to fully avoid cross contamination by means of air. Separate manufacturing facility means separate building (with the proper distance), air handling unit, equipment, all utility excluding electricity and even staff.</p>

                <p>Hormones work slowly, over time, and affect many different processes, including</p>

                <p>Endocrine glands, which are special groups of cells, make hormones. The major endocrine glands are the pituitary, pineal, thymus, thyroid, adrenal glands, and pancreas. In addition, men produce hormones in their testes and women produce them in their ovaries.</p>

                <p>Hormones are powerful. It takes only a tiny amount to cause big changes in cells or even your whole body. That is why too much or too little of a certain hormone can be serious. Laboratory tests can measure the hormone levels in your blood, urine, or saliva.</p>

                <p>Hormone Replacement Therapy is any form of therapy wherein the patient, in the course of medical treatment, receives hormones, either to supplement a lack of naturally occurring hormones, or to substitute other hormones for naturally occurring hormones. Compounded hormones are prepared when these are prescribed in combinations, doses, or preparations not routinely available.</p>

                <p>Hormones can be bio-identical or synthetic.</p>

                <p><em>Bio-identical or natural hormones</em> are hormones identical on a molecular level with endogenous hormones, derived from either soy or yam plant. The body recognizes, absorbs and utilizes these hormones because they are identical to that which it would naturally produce on its own. With bio-identical hormones, side effects are rarely observed and each dose is tailored specifically for the patient’s needs.</p>

                <p><em>Synthetic or conventional hormones</em> are hormones not created structurally the same as human endogenous hormones, which lead to uncomfortable side effects. These may be patented by pharmaceutical companies, therefore dosage varies only by milligrams dictated by the doctor. While synthetic hormones can mimic the effects of endogenous hormones on certain biological pathways, they rarely offer the same effectiveness at a deeper molecular level.</p>

                <p>Given that hormones may it be natural or synthetic can exert a physiologic effect even in minute quantities, proper containment system must be utilized to protect the operator handling it, the product or process itself, and the environment of the facility against these compounds.</p>

                <p>Cytotoxic drugs are agents known to be highly toxic to cells through cell reproduction and are mainly intended for the treatment of cancer. These are designed to prevent the rapid growth and division of cancer cells. Most of these medicines are carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic.</p>

                <p>Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation of the aerosol or airborne dust generated during manipulation, absorption through the skin or direct spilling or needle stick injuries in the transport, preparation, and handling of these drugs.</p>

                <p>The focus of safety during cytotoxic drug preparation is to eliminate or reduce health risks which are implemented through the establishment of written protocols, education and training of personnel, efficient planning and design of the workplace, and use of specialized equipment. Cytotoxic drug safety cabinets, pharmaceutical isolators, and other appropriate equipment are recommended to facilitate safe preparation of chemotherapeutic drugs and to ensure that products, operator, and working environment are protected.</p>

                <p>It should be noted that when dealing with volatile compounds or substances which have tendency to volatilize, an equipment with a dedicated exhaust system ducted outside the facility must be used.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Suspensions may be defined as preparations containing finely divided drug particles (the suspensoid) distributed somewhat uniformly throughout a vehicle in which the drug exhibits a minimum degree of solubility. Some suspensions are available in ready-to-use form, that is, already distributed through a liquid vehicle with or without stabilizers and other additives.</p>

                            <ol>
                            <li style="text-align: justify;">A properly prepared pharmaceutical suspension should settle slowly and should be readily redispersed upon gentle shaking of the container.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: justify;">The particle size of the suspensoid should remain fairly constant throughout long periods of undisturbed standing.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: justify;">The suspension should pour readily and evenly from its container.</li>

                            <p><strong>Physical Features of the Dispersed Phased of a Suspension</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In most good pharmaceutical suspensions, the particle diameter is 1 to 50μm. Generally, particle size reduction is accomplished by dry milling prior to incorporation of the dispersed phase into the dispersion medium. One of the most rapid, convenient, and inexpensive methods of producing fine drug powders of about 10 to 50μm size is micropulverization. Micropulverizers are high-speed attrition or impact mills that are effi cient in reducing powders to the size acceptable for most oral and topical suspensions. For still finer particles, under 10μm, fluid energy grinding, sometimes referred to as jet milling or micronizing, is quite effective. By this process, the shearing action of high-velocity compressed airstreams on the particles in a confined space produces the desired ultrafine or micronized particles. The particles to be micronized are swept into violent turbulence by the sonic and supersonic velocities of the airstreams. The particles are accelerated to high velocities and collide with one another, resulting in fragmentation. This method may be employed when the particles are intended for parenteral or ophthalmic suspensions. Particles of extremely small dimensions may also be produced by spray drying. A spray dryer is a cone-shaped apparatus into which a solution of a drug is sprayed and rapidly dried by a current of warm, dry air circulating in the cone. The resulting dry powder is collected. It is not possible for a pharmacist to achieve the same degree of particle-size reduction with such comminuting equipment as the mortar and pestle.</p>

                            <li><strong>Examples of organic solvents</strong> used are ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, propylene glycol, acetone and polyethylene glycol. </li>
                            <li>A number of important considerations are involved if this method is used:

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Syrups are concentrated aqueous preparations of a sugar or sugar substitute with or without flavoring agents and medicinal substances. Syrups containing flavoring agents but not medicinal substances are called non medicated or flavored vehicles (syrups)</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">These syrups are intended to serve as pleasant tasting vehicles for medicinal substances to be added in the extemporaneous compounding of prescriptions or in the preparation of a standard formula for a medicated syrup, which is a syrup containing a therapeutic agent.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the inability of some children and elderly people to swallow solid dosage forms, it is fairly common today for a pharmacist to be asked to prepare an oral liquid dosage form of a medication available in the pharmacy only as tablets or capsules. In these instances, drug solubility, stability, and bioavailability must be considered case by case.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Medicated syrups are commercially prepared from the starting materials, i.e., by combining each of the individual components of the syrup, such as sucrose, purified water, flavoring agents, coloring agents, the therapeutic agent, and other necessary and desirable ingredients. Naturally, medicated syrups are employed in therapeutics for the value of the medicinal agent present in the syrup.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Syrups provide a pleasant means of administering a liquid form of a disagreeable-tasting drug. They are particularly effective in the administration of drugs to youngsters, since their pleasant taste usually dissipates any reluctance on the part of the child to take the medicine. The fact that syrups contain little or no alcohol adds to their favor among parents</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Components of Syrups</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Most syrups contain the following components in addition to the purifi ed water and any medicinal agents present: (a) the sugar, usually sucrose, or sugar substitute used to provide sweetness and viscosity; (b) antimicrobial preservatives; (c) fl avorants; and (d) colorants. Also, many types of syrups, especially those prepared commercially, contain special solvents, solubilizing agents, thickeners, or stabilizers.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Sucrose- and Nonsucrose-based Syrups </strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Sucrose is the sugar most frequently employed in syrups, although in special circumstances, it may be replaced in whole or in part by other sugars or substances such as sorbitol, glycerin, and propylene glycol. In some instances, all glycogenetic substances (materials converted to glucose in the body), including the agents mentioned earlier, are replaced by nonglycogenetic substances, such as methylcellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose. These two materials are not hydrolyzed and absorbed into the blood stream, and their use results in an excellent syrup-like vehicle for medications intended for use by diabetic patients and others whose diet must be controlled and restricted to nonglycogenetic substances. The viscosity resulting from the use of these cellulose derivatives is much like that of a sucrose syrup. The addition of one or more artifi cial sweeteners usually produces an excellent facsimile of a true syrup.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Preparation of Syrup</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Syrups are most frequently prepared by one of four general methods, depending on the physical and chemical characteristics of the ingredients. Broadly stated, these methods are (a) solution of the ingredients with the aid of heat, (b) solution of the ingredients by agitation without the use of heat, or the simple admixture of liquid components, (c) addition of sucrose to a prepared medicated liquid or to a flavored liquid, and (d) percolation of either the source of the medicating substance or the sucrose.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Solution with the Aid of Heat</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Syrups are prepared by this method when it is desired to prepare the syrup as quickly as possible and when the syrup’s components are not damaged or volatilized by heat. In this method, the sugar is generally added to the purified water, and heat is applied until the sugar is dissolved. Then, other heat-stable components are added to the hot syrup, the mixture is allowed to cool, and its volume is adjusted to the proper level by the addition of purified water. If heat-labile agents or volatile substances, such as volatile flavoring oils and alcohol, are to be added, they are generally added to the syrup after the sugar is dissolved by heat, and the solution is rapidly cooled to room temperature.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The use of heat facilitates rapid solution of the sugar and certain other components of syrups; however, caution must be exercised against becoming impatient and using excessive heat. Sucrose, a disaccharide, may be hydrolyzed into monosaccharides, dextrose (glucose), and fructose (levulose). This hydrolytic reaction is inversion, and the combination of the two monosaccharide products is invert sugar. When heat is applied in the preparation of a sucrose syrup, some inversion of the sucrose is almost certain. The speed of inversion is greatly increased by the presence of acids, the hydrogen ion acting as a catalyst to the reaction. Should inversion occur, the sweetness of the syrup is altered because invert sugar is sweeter than sucrose, and the normally colorless syrup darkens because of the effect of heat on the levulose portion of the invert sugar. When the syrup is greatly overheated, it becomes amber colored as the sucrose caramelizes. Syrups so decomposed are more susceptible to fermentation and to microbial growth than the stable, undecomposed syrups. Because of the prospect of decomposition by heat, syrups cannot be sterilized by autoclaving. The use of boiled purified water in the preparation of a syrup can enhance its permanency, and the addition of preservative agents, when permitted, can protect it during its shelf life. Storage in a tight container is a requirement for all syrups.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Solution by Agitation without the Aid of Heat</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">To avoid heat-induced inversion of sucrose, a syrup may be prepared without heat by agitation. On a small scale, sucrose and other formulative agents may be dissolved in purified water by placing the ingredients in a vessel larger than the volume of syrup to be prepared, permitting thorough agitation of the mixture. This process is more time consuming than the use of heat, but the product has maximum stability. Huge glass lined or stainless steel tanks with mechanical stirrers or agitators are employed in large-scale preparation of syrups.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes simple syrup or some other non-medicated syrup, rather than sucrose, is employed as the sweetening agent and vehicle. In that case, other liquids that are soluble in the syrup or miscible with it may be added and thoroughly mixed to form a uniform product. When solid agents are to be added to a syrup, it is best to dissolve them in minimal amount of purified water and incorporate the resulting solution into the syrup. When solid substances are added directly to a syrup, they dissolve slowly because the viscous nature of the syrup does not permit the solid substance to distribute readily throughout the syrup to the available solvent and also because a limited amount of available water is present in concentrated syrups.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Addition of Sucrose to a Medicated Liquid or to a Flavored Liquid</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Occasionally a medicated liquid, such as a tincture or fluidextract, is employed as the source of medication in the preparation of a syrup. Many such tinctures and fluidextracts contain alcohol-soluble constituents and are prepared with alcoholic or hydro alcoholic vehicles. If the alcohol-soluble components are desired medicinal agents, some means of rendering them water soluble is employed. However, if the alcohol-soluble components are undesirable or unnecessary components of the corresponding syrup, they are generally removed by mixing the tincture or fluidextract with water, allowing the mixture to stand until separation of the water-insoluble agents is complete, and filtering them from the mixture. The filtrate is the medicated liquid to which the sucrose is added in preparation of the syrup. If the tincture or fluidextract is miscible with aqueous preparations, it may be added directly to simple syrup or to a flavored syrup.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Percolation</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In the percolation method, either sucrose may be percolated to prepare the syrup or the source of the medicinal component may be percolated to form an extractive to which sucrose or syrup may be added. This latter method really is two separate procedures: first the preparation of the extractive of the drug and then the preparation of the syrup.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">An example of a syrup prepared by percolation is ipecac syrup, which is prepared by adding glycerin and syrup to an extractive of powdered ipecac obtained by percolation. The drug ipecac, which consists of the dried rhizome and roots of <em>Cephaëlis ipecacuanha</em>, contains the medicinally active alkaloids emetine, cephaeline, and psychotrine. These alkaloids are extracted from the powdered ipecac by percolation with a hydroalcoholic solvent.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The syrup is categorized as an emetic with a usual dose of 15 mL. This amount of syrup is commonly used in the management of poisoning in children when evacuation of the stomach contents is desirable. About 80% of children given this dose will vomit within half an hour. For a household emetic in the event of poisoning, 1-oz. bottles of the syrup are sold without a prescription. Ipecac syrup also has some application as a nauseant expectorant in doses smaller than the emetic dose.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Evidence indicates that many bulimics— most commonly young women in their late teens to early 30s—use the syrup of ipecac to bring on attacks of vomiting in an attempt to lose weight . Pharmacists must be aware of this misuse of the syrup of ipecac and warn these individuals because one of the active ingredients in the syrup is emetine. With continual use of the syrup, emetine builds up toxic levels within the body tissues and can do irreversible damage to the heart muscles in 3 to 4 months, resulting in symptoms mimicking a heart attack. Shortness of breath is the most common symptom in patients who misuse the syrup of ipecac, but some persons describe low blood pressure– related symptoms and irregularities of heartbeat.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Elixirs are clear, sweetened hydroalcoholic solutions intended for oral use and are usually flavored to enhance their palatability. Non medicated elixirs are employed as vehicles, and medicated elixirs are used for the therapeutic effect of the medicinal substances they contain. Compared with syrups, elixirs are usually less sweet and less viscous because they contain a lower proportion of sugar and consequently are less effective than syrups in masking the taste of medicinal substances. However, because of their hydro alcoholic character, elixirs are better able than aqueous syrups to maintain both water soluble and alcohol-soluble components in solution. Also, because of their stable characteristics and the ease with which they are prepared (by simple solution), from a manufacturing standpoint, elixirs are preferred to syrups.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The proportion of alcohol in elixirs varies widely because the individual components of the elixirs have different water and alcohol solubility characteristics. Each elixir requires a specific blend of alcohol and water to maintain all of the components in solution. Naturally, for elixirs containing agents with poor water solubility, the proportion of alcohol required is greater than for elixirs prepared from components having good water solubility. In addition to alcohol and water, other solvents, such as glycerin and propylene glycol, are frequently employed in elixirs as adjunctive solvents.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Although many elixirs are sweetened with sucrose or with a sucrose syrup, some use sorbitol, glycerin, and/or artificial sweeteners. Elixirs having a high alcoholic content usually use an artificial sweetener, such as saccharin, which is required only in small amounts, rather than sucrose, which is only slightly soluble in alcohol and requires greater quantities for equivalent sweetness.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">All elixirs contain flavorings to increase their palatability, and most elixirs have coloring agents to enhance their appearance. Elixirs containing more than 10% to 12% of alcohol are usually self-preserving and do not require the addition of an antimicrobial agent.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Preparation of Elixirs</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Elixirs are usually prepared by simple solution with agitation and/or by admixture of two or more liquid ingredients. Alcohol-soluble and water-soluble components are generally dissolved separately in alcohol and in purified water, respectively. Then the aqueous solution is added to the alcoholic solution, rather than the reverse, to maintain the highest possible alcoholic strength at all times so that minimal separation of the alcohol-soluble components occurs. When the two solutions are completely mixed, the mixture is made to the volume with the specified solvent or vehicle. Frequently, the final mixture will be cloudy, principally because of separation of some of the flavoring oils by the reduced alcoholic concentration. If this occurs, the elixir is usually permitted to stand for a prescribed number of hours to ensure saturation of the hydroalcoholic solvent and to permit the oil globules to coalesce so that they may be more easily removed by filtration. Talc, a frequent filter aid in the preparation of elixirs, absorbs the excessive amounts of oils and therefore assists in their removal from the solution. The presence of glycerin, syrup, sorbitol, and propylene glycol in elixirs generally contributes to the solvent effect of the hydroalcoholic vehicle, assists in the dissolution of the solute, and enhances the stability of the preparation. However, the presence of these materials adds to the viscosity of the elixir and slows the rate of filtration.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Types of Elixirs</strong></p>
                            <div class="rows">

                                    <li><strong>Non-medicated Elixirs</strong>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Non medicated elixirs may be useful to the pharmacist in the extemporaneous filling of prescriptions involving (a) the addition of a therapeutic agent to a pleasant-tasting vehicle and (b) dilution of an existing medicated elixir. In selecting a liquid vehicle for a drug substance, the pharmacist should be concerned with the solubility and stability of the drug substance in water and alcohol. If a hydro alcoholic vehicle is selected, the proportion of alcohol should be only slightly above the amount needed to effect and maintain the drug’s solution. When a pharmacist is called on to dilute an existing medicated elixir, the non -medicated elixir he or she selects as the diluent should have approximately the same alcoholic concentration as the elixir being diluted. Also, the flavor and color characteristics of the diluent should not be in conflict with those of the medicated elixir, and all components should be chemically and physically compatible. In years past, when pharmacists were called on more frequently than today to compound prescriptions, the three most commonly used non-medicated elixirs were aromatic elixir, compound benzaldehyde elixir, and isoalcoholic elixir.</p></li>
                                    <li><strong>Medicated Elixir</strong>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most official and commercial elixirs contain a single therapeutic agent. The main advantage of having only a single therapeutic agent is that the dosage of that single drug may be increased or decreased by simply taking more or less of the elixir, whereas when two or more therapeutic agents are present in the same preparation, it is impossible to increase or decrease the dose of one without an automatic and corresponding adjustment in the dose of the other, which may not be desired. Thus, for patients required to take more than a single medication, many physicians prefer them to take separate preparations of each drug so that if an adjustment in the dosage of one is desired, it may be accomplished without the concomitant adjustment of the other.</p></li>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Tinctures are alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solutions prepared from vegetable materials or from chemical substances. They vary in method of preparation, strength of the active ingredient, alcoholic content, and intended use in medicine or pharmacy. When they are prepared from chemical substances (e.g., iodine, thimerosal), tinctures are prepared by simple solution of the chemical agent in the solvent.</p>
                            <div style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;"><img class="my-3" src="/images/upload/tincture.jpg" alt="Tincture" class="img-responsive"></div>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the preparation, tinctures contain alcohol in amounts ranging from approximately 15% to 80%. The alcohol content protects against microbial growth and keeps the alcohol-soluble extractives in solution. In addition to alcohol, other solvents, such as glycerin, may be employed. The solvent mix of each tincture is important in maintaining the integrity of the product. Tinctures cannot be mixed successfully with liquids too diverse in solvent character because the solute may precipitate. For example, compound benzoin tincture, prepared with alcohol as the sole menstruum, contains alcohol-soluble principles that are immediately precipitated from solution upon addition of water.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Because of the alcoholic content, tinctures must be tightly stoppered and not exposed to excessive temperatures. Also, because many of the constituents found in tinctures undergo a photochemical change upon exposure to light, many tinctures must be stored in light-resistant containers and protected from sunlight.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Medicated tinctures taken orally include Paregoric, USP, or camphorated tincture of opium. Usually, patients requiring oral medication nowadays prefer to take a tablet or capsule or a pleasant-tasting elixir or syrup. Tinctures have a rather high alcoholic content, and some physicians and patients alike prefer other forms of medication. Opium Tincture, USP, or laudanum, is much more potent than paregoric, and the two should not be confused. Any prescription for either one should be carefully evaluated and the dose checked and confirmed.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Aromatic waters are clear, aqueous solutions saturated with volatile oils or other aromatic or volatile substances. Aromatic waters are no longer in widespread use. In years past, aromatic waters were prepared from a number of volatile substances, including orange flower oil, peppermint oil, rose oil, anise oil, spearmint oil, wintergreen oil, camphor, and chloroform. Naturally, the odors and tastes of aromatic waters are of the volatile substances from which they are prepared. Most of the aromatic substances in the preparation of aromatic waters have very low solubility in water, and even though the water may be saturated, its concentration of aromatic material is still rather small. Aromatic waters may be used for perfuming and/or flavoring.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Spirits are alcoholic or hydro alcoholic solutions of volatile substances. Generally, the alcoholic concentration of spirits is rather high, usually over 60%. Because of the greater solubility of aromatic or volatile substances in alcohol than in water, spirits can contain a greater concentration of these materials than the corresponding aromatic waters. When mixed with water or with an aqueous preparation, the volatile substances present in spirits generally separate from the solution and form a milky preparation. Spirits may be used pharmaceutically as flavoring agents and medicinally for the therapeutic value of the aromatic solute. As flavoring agents, they are used to impart the flavor of their solute to other pharmaceutical preparations. For medicinal purposes, spirits may be taken orally, applied externally, or used by inhalation, depending upon the particular preparation. When taken orally, they are generally mixed with a portion of water to reduce the pungency of the spirit. Depending on the materials, spirits may be prepared by simple solution, solution by maceration, or distillation. The spirits most recently official in the USP–NF are aromatic ammonia spirit, camphor spirit, compound orange spirit, and peppermint spirit.</p>

The so-called vanishing creams are oil-in-water emulsions containing large percentages of water and stearic acid or other oleaginous components. After application of the cream, the water evaporates, leaving behind a thin residue fi lm of the stearic acid or other oleaginous component. Chapter 14 discusses the types of emulsions, their physical characteristics, and method of manufacture. Creams fi nd primary application in topical skin products and in products used rectally and vaginally. Many patients and physicians prefer creams to ointments because they are easier to spread and remove. Pharmaceutical manufacturers frequently manufacture topical preparations of a drug in both cream and ointment bases to satisfy the preference of the patient and physician</p>

                                    <li>Device used to deliver the drug (e.g., teaspoon, syringe, nebulizer, IV fluid, infusion pump)</li>
                                    <li>Design feature of the dose form that affects the delivery of the drug, such as the coating on some capsules that resists breakdown by the gastric fluids in the stomach so that the capsule will release medication, instead, into the intestines</li>

                                <p><em><b>Drug Delivery systems</b></em>&nbsp;differ in their pharmacological properties; that is, their sites of action, rate of delivery, and quantities of active ingredient delivered differ. Consider, for example, the drug nitroglycerin, commonly used to treat angina pectoris (pain in the chest and left arm associated with a sudden decrease in blood supply to the heart).</p><p>Nitroglycerin dilates blood vessels, thus increasing blood supply to the heart and decreasing blood pressure. Three common delivery systems for nitroglycerin are sublingual tablets, placed under the tongue; ointment measured and applied directly on the skin; and transdermal patches, worn on the skin. Sublingual nitroglycerin tablets are fast acting but deliver their active ingredient for only a short period of time, about 30 minutes. Transdermal patches, in contrast, act slowly, with a delivery onset of about 30 minutes, but they can deliver a steady amount of the drug for up to 24 hours. The ointment is much less costly than the patch; it has a similar onset but a shorter duration of effect (up to 12 hours). The choice of delivery system depends on many factors, including the following:</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Sprays may be defined as aqueous or oleaginous solutions in the form of coarse droplets or as finely divided solids to be applied topically, most usually to the nasopharyngeal tract or to the skin. Many commercial sprays are used intranasally to relieve nasal congestion and inflammation and to combat infection and contain antihistamines, sympathomimetic agents, and antibiotic substances. Because of the noninvasive nature and quickness with which nasal sprays can deliver medication systemically, in the future, several drugs that typically have been administered by other routes will be taken nasally. Most notably, insulin and glucagon will be administered in this fashion. Research has demonstrated that the administration of glucagon via a nasal spray can relieve hypoglycemic symptoms within 7 minutes, a definite advantage over conventional emergency intravenous glucose or intramuscular glucagon.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Other sprays that are employed against sunburn and heat burn contain local anesthetics, antiseptics, skin protectants, and antipruritics. Throat sprays containing antiseptics, deodorants, and flavorants may be effectively employed to relieve conditions such as halitosis, sore throat, and laryngitis. Other sprays treat athlete’s foot and other fungal infections. Numerous other medicinal and cosmetic uses of sprays are commonly available in pharmacies.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">To break up a solution into small particles so that it may be effectively sprayed or to facilitate the spraying of a powder, several mechanical devices are commonly employed. The plastic spray bottle, gently squeezed to issue a spray of its contents, is familiar to most. It is commonly used for nasal decongestant sprays as well as cosmetically, especially for body deodorant products. Recently, one-way pump sprays have been developed to deliver medication into the nose. These sprays are used for both prescription, such as Nasalide (Syntex), and nonprescription, such as Nostrilla (Boehringer Ingelheim), medicines. The advantage of these over conventional sprays is that the design prevents drawback contamination of nasal fluids into the bottle after administration, a definite advantage for someone trying to cope with viruses associated with the common cold. Pharmacists are familiar with medicinal atomizers, which emit medication in the form of fi ne droplets. One type of atomizer has a rubber bulb at the end of the apparatus, which when squeezed causes a flow of air, some of which enters the glass reservoir and some of which exits from the opposite end of the system. The air forced into the reservoir causes the liquid to rise in a small dip tube, forcing the solution up and into the stream of air exiting the system. The air and the solution are forced through a jet opening and the liquid is broken up into a spray, the droplets being carried by the airstream. In other similar apparatus, the stream of air caused by the depression of the bulb does not enter the reservoir of solution but passes swiftly over it, creating a pressure change and sucking the liquid into the dip tube and into the airstream, in which it exits the system.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Liniments are alcoholic or oleaginous solutions or emulsions of various medicinal substances intended to be rubbed on the skin. Liniments with an alcoholic or hydroalcoholic vehicle are useful when rubefacient, counterirritant, or penetrating action is desired; oleaginous liniments are employed primarily when massage is desired. By their nature, oleaginous liniments are less irritating to the skin than alcoholic liniments. Liniments are not applied to skin areas that are broken or bruised because excessive irritation might result. The vehicle for a liniment should therefore be selected for the type of action desired (rubefacient, counterirritant, or massage) and also on the solubility of the desired components in the various solvents. For oleaginous liniments, the solvent may be a fixed oil such as almond oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, or cottonseed oil or a volatile substance such as wintergreen oil or turpentine, or it may be a combination of fixed and volatile oils.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">All liniments should bear a label indicating that they are suitable only for external use and must never be taken internally. Liniments that are emulsions or that contain insoluble matter must be shaken thoroughly before use to ensure even distribution of the dispersed phase, and these preparations should be labeled shake well. Liniments should be stored in tight containers. Depending on their individual ingredients, liniments are prepared in the same manner as solutions, emulsions, or suspensions, as the case may warrant.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Collodions are liquid preparations composed of pyroxylin dissolved in a solvent mixture usually composed of alcohol and ether with or without added medicinal substances. Pyroxylin (i.e., nitrocellulose, soluble gun cotton, collodion cotton, etc.), obtained by the action of a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids on cotton, consists chiefl y of cellulose tetranitrate. It has the appearance of raw cotton when dry but is harsh to the touch. It is frequently available commercially moistened with about 30% alcohol or other similar solvent. One part of pyroxylin is slowly but completely soluble in 25 parts of a mixture of 3 volumes of ether and 1 volume of alcohol. It is also soluble in acetone and glacial acetic acid. Pyroxylin is precipitated from solution in these solvents upon the addition of water. Pyroxylin, like collodions, is exceedingly flammable and must be stored away from flame in well-closed containers, protected from light.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Collodions are intended for external use. When applied to the skin with a fi ne camel’s hair brush or glass applicator, the solvent rapidly evaporates, leaving a filmy residue of pyroxylin. This provides an occlusive protective coating to the skin, and when the collodion is medicated, it leaves a thin layer of that medication firmly placed against the skin. Naturally, collodions must be applied to dry tissues to adhere to the skin’s surface. The products must be clearly labeled “for external use only” or with words of similar effect.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Collodion is a clear or slightly opalescent viscous liquid prepared by dissolving pyroxylin (4% w/v) in a 3:1 mixture of ether and alcohol. The resulting solution is highly volatile and flammable and should be preserved in a tight container remote from fi re at a temperature not exceeding 30°C.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">The product is capable of forming a protective fi lm on application to the skin and the volatilization of the solvent. The fi lm is useful in holding the edges of an incised wound together. However, its presence on the skin is uncomfortable because of its inflexible nature. The following product, which is fl exible, has a greater appeal when a pliable fi lm is acceptable.</p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 20px"><strong>Flexible Collodion</strong></p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Flexible collodion is prepared by adding 2% camphor and 3% castor oil to collodion. The castor oil renders the product fl exible, permitting its comfortable use over skin areas that are normally moved, such as joints, fi ngers, and toes. The camphor makes the product waterproof. Physicians frequently apply the coating over bandages or stitched incisions to make them waterproof and to protect them from external stress.</p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 20px"><strong>Salicylic Acid Collodion</strong></p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Salicylic acid collodion is a 10% solution of salicylic acid in flexible collodion. It is used for its keratolytic effects, especially in the removal of corns from the toes. Patients who use such products should be advised about their proper use. The product should be applied one drop at a time on the corn or wart, allowing time to dry before the next drop is added. Because salicylic acid can irritate normal, healthy skin, every attempt must be made to ensure application directly on the corn or wart. A useful preventive measure is to line the adjacent healthy skin with some white petrolatum prior to application of the product. Proper tightening and storage of the product after use are absolutely necessary because of the volatility of the vehicle.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Solutions may be prepared from powders as indicated earlier or from liquid solutions or liquid concentrates. In using liquid concentrates, the patient is instructed to add the prescribed amount of concentrate (usually a teaspoonful or capful) to a certain amount of warm water (frequently a quart). The resultant solution contains the appropriate amount of chemical agents in proper strength. The agents are similar to the ones described for douche powders.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Powders are used to prepare solutions for vaginal douche, i.e., for irrigation cleansing of the vagina. The powders themselves may be prepared and packaged in bulk or as unit packages. A unit package is designed to contain the appropriate amount of powder to prepare the specifi ed volume of douche solution. The bulk powders are used by the teaspoonful or tablespoonful in preparation of the desired solution. The user simply adds the prescribed amount of powder to the appropriate volume of warm water and stirs until dissolved.</p>
                            <p>Among the components of douche powders are the following:</p>
                            <ol>
                            <li>Boric acid or sodium borate</li>
                            <li>Astringents, for example, potassium, alum, ammonium alum, zinc sulfate</li>
                            <li>Antimicrobials, for example, oxyquinoline sulfate, povidone iodine</li>
                            <li>Quaternary ammonium compounds, for example, benzethonium chloride</li>
                            <li>Detergents, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate</li>
                            <li>Oxidizing agents, for example, sodium perborate</li>
                            <li>Salts, for example, sodium citrate, sodium chloride</li>
                            <li>Aromatics, for example, menthol, thymol, eucalyptol, methyl salicylate, phenol</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Douche powders are used for their hygienic effects. A few douche powders containing specific therapeutic anti-infective agents such as those mentioned in the discussion of vaginal suppositories are used against monilial and trichomonal infections.</p>

                            <p><strong>Retention Enema</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">A number of solutions are administered rectally for local effects (e.g., hydrocortisone) or for systemic absorption (e.g., aminophylline). In the case of aminophylline, rectal administration minimizes the undesirable gastrointestinal reactions associated with oral therapy. Clinically effective blood levels of the agents are usually obtained within 30 minutes following rectal instillation. Corticosteroids are administered as retention enemas or continuous drip as adjunctive treatment of some patients with ulcerative colitis.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Rectal enemas are used to cleanse the bowel. Commercially, many enemas are available in disposable plastic squeeze bottles containing a premeasured amount of enema solution. The agents are solutions of sodium phosphate and sodium biphosphate, glycerin and docusate potassium, and light mineral oil. Instruction from a pharmacist is advantageous to ensure that the patient correctly uses these products. The patient should be advised to gently insert the tip of the product with steady pressure and be told that it is not absolutely necessary to squeeze all of the contents out of the disposable plastic bottle. The patient should be told that the product will most probably work within 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Suppositories are solid dosage forms intended for insertion into body orifices where they melt, soften, or dissolve and exert local or systemic effects. The derivation of the word suppository is from the Latin supponere, meaning “to place under,” as derived from sub (under) and ponere (to place).</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Rectal Suppositories</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Rectal suppositories are usually about 32 mm (1.5 in.) long, are cylindrical, and have one or both ends tapered. Some rectal suppositories are shaped like a bullet, a torpedo, or the little fi nger. Depending on the density of the base and the medicaments in the suppository, the weight may vary. Adult rectal suppositories weigh about 2 g when cocoa butter (theobroma oil) is employed as the base. Rectal suppositories for use by infants and children are about half the weight and size of the adult suppositories and assume a more pencillike shape.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Urethral Suppositories</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Suppositories for urethral administration tend to be thinner and tapered, often about 5 mm in diameter. They have been used in the treatment of local infections, and a much smaller urethral suppository has been introduced for the administration of alprostadil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Vaginal Suppositories</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">These preparations are employed principally to combat infections in the female genitourinary tract, to restore the vaginal mucosa to its normal state, and for contraception. The usual pathogenic organisms are <em>Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida (Monilia) albicans or other species, </em>and<em> Haemophilus vaginalis</em>. Among the anti-infective agents in commercial vaginal preparations are nystatin, clotrimazole, butoconazole nitrate, terconazole, and miconazole (antifungals) and triple sulfas, sulfanilamide, povidone iodine, clindamycin phosphate, metronidazole, and oxytetracycline (antibacterials). Nonoxynol-9, a spermicide, is employed for vaginal contraception. Estrogenic substances such as dienestrol are found in vaginal preparations to restore the vaginal mucosa to its normal state.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The most commonly used base for vaginal suppositories consists of combinations of the various molecular weight polyethylene glycols. To this base is frequently added surfactants and preservative agents, commonly the parabens. Many vaginal suppositories and other types of vaginal dosage forms are buffered to an acid pH usually about 4.5, consistent with the normal vagina. This acidity discourages pathogenic organisms and provides a favorable environment for eventual recolonization by the acid- producing bacilli normally found in the vagina. The polyethylene glycol–based vaginal suppositories are water miscible and are generally suffi ciently fi rm for the patient to handle and insert without great diffi culty. However, to make the task easier, many manufacturers provide plastic insertion devices that are used to hold the suppository or tablet for proper placement within the vagina.</p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Packaging and Storage</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Glycerin suppositories and glycerinated gelatin suppositories are packaged in tightly closed glass containers to prevent a change in moisture content. Suppositories prepared from a cocoa butter base are usually individually wrapped or otherwise separated in compartmented boxes to prevent contact and adhesion. Suppositories containing light-sensitive drugs are individually wrapped in an opaque material such as a metallic foil. In fact, most commercial suppositories are individually wrapped in either foil or plastic. Some are packaged in a continuous strip, separated by tearing along perforations. Suppositories are also commonly packaged in slide boxes or in plastic boxes.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Because suppositories are adversely affected by heat, it is necessary to maintain them in a cool place. Cocoa butter suppositories must be stored below 30°C (86°F), and preferably in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C, or 36°F to 46°F). Glycerinated gelatin suppositories can be stored at controlled room temperature (20°C to 25°C, or 68°F to 77°F).</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Suppositories made from a base of polyethylene glycol may be stored at usual room temperatures. Suppositories stored in high humidity may absorb moisture and tend to become spongy, whereas suppositories stored in places of extreme dryness may lose moisture and become brittle.</p>

                            <li><p><strong>By Fusion Molding</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This step involves first melting the suppository base, and then dispersing or dissolving the drug in the melted base. The mixture is removed from the heat and poured into a suppository mold. When the mixture has congealed, the suppositories are removed from the mold. The fusion method can be used with all types of suppositories and must be used with most of them.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Suppositories are generally made from solid ingredients and drugs which are measured by weight. When they are mixed, melted, and poured into suppository mold cavities, they occupy a volume – the volume of the mold cavity. Since the components are measured by weight but compounded by volume, density calculations and mold calibrations are required to provide accurate doses.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">When a drug is placed in a suppository base, it will displace an amount of base as a function of its density. If the drug has the same density as the base, it will displace an equivalent weight of the base. If the density of the drug is greater than that of the base, it will displace a proportionally smaller weight of the base. Density factors for common drugs in cocoa butter are available in standard reference texts. The density factor is used to determine how much of a base will be displaced by a drug.</p>

                            <li><p><strong>By Compression</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Suppositories may be prepared by forcing the mixed mass of the base and the medicaments into special molds using suppository-making machines. In preparation for compression into the molds, the base and the other formulative ingredients are combined by thorough mixing, the friction of the process softening the base into a pastelike consistency. On a small scale, a mortar and pestle may be used. Heating the mortar in warm water (then drying it) greatly facilitates the softening of the base and the mixing. On a large scale, a similar process may be used, employing mechanical kneading mixers and a warm mixing vessel.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Compression is especially suited for making suppositories that contain heat-labile medicinal substances or a great deal of substances that are insoluble in the base. In contrast to the molding method, compression permits no likelihood of insoluble matter settling during manufacture. The disadvantage to compression is that the special suppository machine is required and there is some limitation as to the shapes of suppositories that can be made.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In preparing suppositories with the compression machine, the suppository mass is placed in a cylinder; the cylinder is closed; pressure is applied from one end, mechanically or by turning a wheel; and the mass is forced out of the other end into the mold or die. When the die is filled with the mass, a movable end plate at the back of the die is removed, and when additional pressure is applied to the mass in the cylinder, the formed suppositories are ejected. The end plate is returned and the process is repeated until all of the mass has been used. Various sizes and shapes of dies are available. It is possible to prepare suppositories of uniform circumference by extrusion through a perforated plate and by cutting the extruded mass to the desired length.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>By Molding</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The steps in molding include (a) melting the base, (b) incorporating any required medicaments, (c) pouring the melt into molds, (d) allowing the melt to cool and congeal into suppositories, and (e) removing the formed suppositories from the mold. Cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, polyethylene glycol, and most other bases are suitable for preparation by molding</p></li>

                <h4>Inhalation</h4>
                <img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 438px; height: 292px;" src="/images/upload/inhalation.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                <p><strong>Metered-dose Inhalers</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Metered-dose inhaler product contain therapeutically active ingredients dissolved or suspended in a propellant, a mixture of propellant, or a mixture of solvents, propellants, and/or other excipients in compact pressurized aerosol dispensers. An MDI product may discharge up to several hundred metered doses of one or more drug substances. Depending on the product, each actuation may contain from a few microorganisms (mcg) up to milligrams (mg) of the active ingredients delivered in a volume typically between 25 and 100 microliters.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Although similar in many features to other drug products, MDIs have unique differences with respect to formulation, container, closure, manufacturing, in-process and final controls, and stability. These differences need to be considered during the development program because they can affect the ability of the product to deliver reproducible doses to patients over the life of the product to deliver reproducible doses to patients over the life of the product as well as the product’s efficacy. Some of the unique features of MDIs are listed below:</p>
                <ol style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>The container, the valve, the actuator, the formulation, any associated accessories (e.g., spacers), and protective packaging collectively constitute the drug product. Unlike most other drug products, the dosing and performance and, therefore, the clinical efficacy of a MDI may be directly dependent on the design of the container and closure system (CCS).</li>
                <li>The fraction of the formulation delivered to the patient consists of a mixture of micronized (or solubilized) drug substance in the desired physical form, which may be within a residual matrix of oily excipient material, propellant and/or solvent.</li>
                <li>Fixed portions of medication from a multi dose container can be directly administered to the patient without contamination or exposure of the remaining material under normal use conditions. Conversely, portions of the immediate container’s content cannot be removed from a pressurized container for further modification or manipulation.</li>
                <li>The aerosolization of materials from a pressurized container is a complex and rapid sequence of events. When the content of the metering chamber is released, it undergoes volume expansion and forms a mixture of gas and liquid before being discharged as a jet through the orifice of the actuator. Within the expanding jet, the droplets undergo a series of processes. Subsequent to the aerosolization and dispersion of the drug product into a multiple of droplets, and during the propulsion of these droplets from the actuator to the biological target, the drug substance particles in the droplets become progressively more concentrated due to the rapid evaporation of the volatile propellant components.</li>
                <li>The concept of classical bioequivalence and bioavailability is usually not applicable for oral inhalation aerosols. The dose administered is typically so small that blood or serum concentrations are generally undetectable by routine analytical methods. Moreover, bio equivalency studies are complicated by the fact that only approximately 10-15 percent of the dose reaches the biological target. The remainder of the dose, trapped in the mouth and pharynx, is swallowed and absorbed through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</li>
                <li>Clinical efficacy assessment of inhalation aerosols requires consideration of several parameters, such as:</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="rows">
                <ul style="text-align: justify;" class="list-circle">
                <li>Variability in the disease itself.</li>
                <li>Administration skills and practices, for example, breath holding and its duration, patient inspiratory flow rate, discharging either via closed lips around the mouthpiece or into the open mouth, coordination of aerosol discharge and inhalation by the patient, add-on devices, proper priming of the valve and cleaning practices for the actuator, proper handling and fitting of the actuator to the valve stem;</li>
                <li>Presence of other drugs which may exacerbate differences between products;</li>
                <li>Drug product variability due to physical characteristics and controls of the drug substance, optimized formulation, valve and actuator design, manufacturing process and in-process controls.</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs)</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Current designs of DPI include pre-metered and device-metered DPIs, both of which can be driven by patient inspiration alone or with power-assistance of some type. Pre-metered DPIs contain previously measured doses or dose fractions in some type of units (e.g., single or multiple presentations in blister, capsules, or other cavities) that are subsequently inserted into the device during manufacture or by the patient before use. The dose may be inhaled directly from the pre-metered unit or it may be transferred to a chamber before being inhaled directly from the pre-metered unit or it may be transferred to a chamber before being inhaled by the patient. Device-metered DPIs have an internal reservoir containing sufficient formulation for multiple doses that are metered by the device itself during actuation by the patient. The wide array of DPI designs, many with characteristics unique to the design, will present challenges in developing information in support application. Regardless of the DPI design, the most crucial attributes are the reproducibility of the dose and particle size distribution.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>These are the key distinctions of DPIs</strong></p>
                <ol>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">The device with all of its parts, including any protective packaging (e.g., overwrap), and the formulation together constitute the drug product. Unlike most other drug products, the dosing and performance and therefore the clinical efficacy of a DPI may be directly dependent on the design of the device.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">The portion of the formulation that is delivered by inhalation to the patient consists of the neat drug substance controlled to a suitable particle size distribution (e.g., micronized, spray-dried) or the drug substance contained within a matrix of excipients.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">Energy is required for dispersion and aerosolization of the formulation and the drug substance. Whereas MDIs use energy stored in a liquefied gas propellant under pressure for aerosolization and dispersion. DPIs may rely on several energy sources, including energy from patient inspiration, from compressed gas, or from a motor-driven impeller.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">Whereas MDIs administer doses of the drug substance formulation to the patient without contamination of the remaining formulation under normal use conditions, this is not necessarily the case with DPIs.&nbsp; In particular, device-metered DPIs can be susceptible to contamination (e.g., moisture, microbial) of the remaining dose. Contamination aspects under both in-use and abuse conditions should be considered during development of the drug product.</li>
                <li style="text-align: justify;">In DPIs, complex and subtle interactions may occur between the drug substance, carrier(s), and components of the container and closure system that significantly affect the safety and effectiveness of the drug product.</li>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Injections are sterile, pyrogen limited, that is, bacterial endotoxin units limit, preparations intended to be administered parenterally. The term parenteral refers to the injectable routes of administration. It derives from the Greek words <em>para</em> (outside) and <em>enteron</em> (intestine) and denotes routes of administration other than the oral route. Pyrogens, or bacterial endotoxins, are organic metabolic products shed from Gram-negative bacteria which can cause fever and hypotension in patients when they are in excessive amounts in intravenous (IV) injections.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intravenous Route</strong> - IV drugs provide rapid action compared with other routes of administration, and because drug absorption is not a factor, optimum blood levels may be achieved with accuracy and immediacy not possible by other routes. In emergencies, IV administration of a drug may be lifesaving because of the placement of the drug directly into the circulation and the prompt action that ensues.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intramuscular Route</strong> - IM injections of drugs provide effects that are less rapid but generally longer lasting than those obtained from IV administration. Aqueous or oleaginous solutions or suspensions of drug substances may be administered intramuscularly. Depending on the type of preparation, absorption rates vary widely. Drugs in solution are more rapidly absorbed than those in suspension, and drugs in aqueous preparations are more rapidly absorbed than oleaginous preparations. The physical type of preparation is based on the properties of the drug itself and on the therapeutic goals</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Subcutaneous Route</strong> - The SC route may be used for injection of small amounts of medication. Injection of a drug beneath the skin is usually made in the loose interstitial tissue of the outer upper arm, the anterior thigh, or the lower abdomen. The site of injection is usually rotated when injections are frequently given, as with daily insulin injections. Prior to injection, the skin at the injection site should be thoroughly cleansed.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intradermal Route</strong> - A number of substances may be effectively injected into the corium, the more vascular layer of the skin just beneath the epidermis. These substances include various agents for diagnostic determinations, desensitization, or immunization.</p>

                <p>These are values set to prevent occupational diseases, notably in personnel exposed to harmful chemicals in the workplace. OELs are often expressed in mg/m3 especially for metals, salts and other compounds that do not form vapours at room temperature and pressure. However, some OELs may be expressed in units such as fibres/cc while a few are expressed in parts per million (ppm) if the substance exists as a gas or vapour at normal room temperature and pressure.</p>

                <p>It should be noted that these bands are rules of thumb for guidance only.</p>

                <p><strong>Each application must be assessed based on the following criteria:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Product dustiness - the smaller the particle size the more likely it is the powder may get airborne.</li>
                    <li>Type of product - if the product is cytotoxic/genotoxic and the requirement is in the 1-5 microgram range, consider full containment (isolator) unless the quantity/process is not practical for full isolation. If full isolation is not practical, operators should use additional protective equipment (full air fed suit) and the downflow booth room access must be via an airlock.</li>
                    <li>The process - if the process imparts high energy to the powder, such as milling.</li>
                    <li>The time taken to carry out the process - the longer the process time, the higher the potential risk of exposure.</li>
                    <li>The quantity of powder handled at any one time - the higher the quantity, typically the higher the risk (bearing in mind the above, that is if the powder is granular i.e. sand like, the risk may not be that high).</li>
                </ol>

            <p>Animal Biosafety Level (ABSL) is provided for work with vertebrate animals exposed to agents which may infect humans. ABSL 1 thru 4, provide for practices, equipment, and facilities that are comparable to the laboratory biosafety levels. However, there are unique hazards associated with infected animals that must be understood by those personnel with animal contact and addressed in the animal facility. ABSLs are designed to protect personnel from exposure to potentially infectious materials.</p>

                <p>The use of radiation in the diagnosis and treatment of patients has considerably advanced the medical field, and has extended and saved numerous lives. Radiation usage come with risks. To ensure safety, it is mandatory that personnel involved in practices with radiation be trained in radiation safety, radiation physics, biologic effects of radiation, injury prevention, among others.</p>

                <p>Standard procedures, best practices, facilities, and equipment for the preparation and dispensing of radiopharmaceuticals are essential to any radiopharmacy operation. Appropriate engineering controls and work practices are intended to ensure the sterility of compounded preparations as well as protection of the operator from exposure to radioactivity. It is important to note that using engineering controls and proper standard operating procedures do not totally eliminate radiation. It only minimizes or attenuates the dose that the operator is exposed to.</p>

                <p>Radiation safety conditions, as stated in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter 825, take into account 4 main factors: time, distance, shielding and radiation contamination control.  Time handling radioactive materials (RAMs) is directly proportional to radiation exposure; hence, minimizing handling time will minimize radiation exposure. Distance, on the other hand, follows the inverse square law. Thus, increase in distance between the personnel and RAM will decrease radiation exposure to the worker by square of the distance.  Use of shielding materials (e.g., lead, tungsten) also decreases radiation exposure to personnel. For this reason, the use of shielding (e.g.,  L-block, torso, vial, and syringe shields) is often required through the radiopharmaceutical handling processing, including within a primary engineering control (PEC). Primary engineering control (PEC) is defined as a device or zone that provides an ISO Class 5 air quality environment for sterile compounding. Lastly, RAM contamination (e.g., spills, drips, sprays, volatility) is vital with regard to radiation protection. Therefore, application of various techniques and materials may be done in order to minimize radioactive contaminations.

                <p>Esco is committed in providing quality equipment with the highest level of containment to protect the operator, product and the environment from hazardous substances.</p>

                <p>With the present trend being observed in the handling of highly potent medicines (e.g., hormonal drugs, cancer drugs and other active pharmaceutical ingredients), containment issues in pharmaceutical facilities have become a rapidly essential facet. Today, more than 50% of all new chemical entities (NCEs) being classified as potent (OEL &lt; 10 micrograms/ m<sup>3</sup>), necessitates specific consideration: it is crucial to prevent operators/ personnel exposure to the drug as well as the cross-contamination of other substances being processed within in the same facility.</p>

                <p>Chemical hazard reduction can be achieved through employment of safe practices, use of suitable engineering controls for containment, use of personal protective equipment, and/or substitution of the chemical to a less harmful one.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Explosive atmospheres are classified into area classes by ATEX Directive 99/92/EC. This classification is applied to atmospheres where a combination of dusts, aerosols, vapors, gases, and air form an explosive mixture. Examples of areas where this standard must be applied are: oil refineries, paint shops, biogas power plants and peat processing plants.</p>
                <img class="my-3" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 224px; height: 224px;" src="/images/upload/atex1.jpg">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The ATEX Directive 94/9/EC pertains to the equipment and protection systems intended to be used in explosive atmospheres. In generel, this Directive is called as ATEX Equipment Directive. It is applied to all equipment and components intended to be used in areas where explosive liquids, gases, or dusts are present. For example, the following equipment is classified primarily as primary ATEX equipment: electrical and mechanical equipment, protection systems, safety and control systems, and the components of equipment protection systems. The scope of the Directive does not include medical equipment, household gas equipment or facilities for storing explosives. International standard IEC 60079-0 and the CENELEC EN 60079-0 standard contain more detailed specifications for equipment and requirements.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The main principle behind this safety classification is to prevent the formation of an explosive atmosphere. This is done by eliminating sources of ignition and by minimizing the consequences of possible explosions (94/9/EC). The most important thing is to take all safety requirements into account. These may include all sources of ignition, faults, and potentially incorrect usages. The safety specifications also include safety, maintenance, and protection instructions and related markings.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Common Principles of Explosion and Risk Management</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">An explosion is a sudden increase in volume and a release of energy in a harmful manner. Usually it involves the generation of high temperatures and the release of gases. An explosion causes pressure waves. Explosions are categorized as deflagrations if these waves are subsonic and detonations if they are supersonic (shock waves). The third type is a thermal explosion, which occurs with the rapid conversion of a highly exothermic reaction accompanied by a temperature rise. The disastrous property of an explosion comes with a rise in pressure and often with a high dose of heat radiation from the fireball, both occurring in a very short period of time. In ATEX areas, causes of explosion must be eliminated or minimized.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">To generate the sudden chemical reaction of an oxygen and flammable substance compound, the mixture must be in an explosion range to release a high-energy explosion. Flammable substances normally occur in the form of a dust, mist, gas, or vapor. Normally, an explosion occurs only if the following three main factors react in a convenient mixture:</p>
                <ol style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Flammable material</li>
                <li>Oxygen</li>
                <li>Ignition source</li>
                </ol>
                <p style="text-align: justify;" class="mt-3">Flammable materials includes flammable gases, flammable liquids, and flammable solids. Of these, a flammable liquid can occur as a form of mists and also as a vapor. Some of the substances may need only very little energy to react. Normally, gases and vapors are the most flammable. In flammable materials, solids can be in the form of dust, fiber, or flock. The reaction of flammable solids causes a rapid temperature rise and high pressure. Normally solids need more energy to react than gases but the energy of the reaction causes heavy explosions.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The ignition of an explosion can be started by several sources:</p>
                <div class="rows">
                <ol class="list-circle" style="text-align: justify; list-style-type: circle; padding-left: 15px;">

                <p style="text-align: justify;" class="mt-3">Structures must be designed to eliminate all electro-static charges. Generally charges are formed when two materials with different charges come into contact with each other. A larger contact area or greater distance between the surfaces of the materials touching each other increases the likelihood of a charge. Danger of an increasing charge in material increases when the resistivity of the other material decreases.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">If the material has a charge, an electro-static discharge may occur. A charge can be discharged in many ways, but the most common ways are spark discharges and brush discharges. Both of these can cause a dangerous ignition, because the energy released can ignite gases and vapors. A spark discharge occurs when the charge between two conductors in different potentials increases to a sufficient level. In brush discharge, energy is released when a charged object is approached by a round conductive object.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">These charges can be eliminated effectively by using potential equalization or grounding. Potential equalization refers to the connection of two conductive objects to each other. Grounding refers to the connection of a conductive object to the ground potential. Discharging must be used when the protective structure is used in a space where explosion group IIC gases are present and the thickness of a non-conductive surface layer exceeds 0.2 mm or the surface resistivity exceeds 1 GΩ. In equipment class two it must be ensured that the projection surface area of non-conductive components, such as value plates and stickers, does not exceed 20 cm<sup>2</sup>. If the non-conductive surface is surrounded by a grounded frame, its surface area can be multiplied by four.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Explosion Groups</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The specification contains three explosion groups. These groups are based on the measured ignition capabilities of gases and vapors at a certain temperature. The classification is split into sections I and II, and groups designated A, B, and C. For example, group A contains common alcohols with a low flash temperature and group C contains gaseous hydrogen with a relatively high flash temperature.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Classification of Zones</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Area classes are divided into two categories based on the material type. The categories are air/gas mixtures, vapor, particles and air/dust mixtures. Area classifications clarify the protection principles and levels for areas specified in the explosion protection document. This ensures correct selection of the protection principle and maintains cost-efficiency.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Dust atmospheres</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Dust atmospheres, in accordance with IEC 60079-10-2 and IEC 60079-31, are classified in different zones. IEC 60079 gives guidance on how to identify and classify the areas where hazards from dust can occur. The area classification method evaluates the material’s properties emission sources, dust layers and formation probability of an explosive dust-air mixture.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Zone 20</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">An area where combustible dust, as a cloud, is present continuously or frequently during normal operation. Areas, such as the inside parts of equipment, e.g. mixers, silos, filters, mills, transfer pipes, and closed conveyors.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Zone 21</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">An area where combustible dust, as a cloud id likely to occur during normal operation. Areas, such as filling and emptying areas and places where dust accumulates and the probability for formation of an air-dust mixture is high.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Zone 22</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">An area where combustible dust clouds may occur infrequently and persist for only short periods. Areas such as storage facilities of closed packages, outlet sides of air filters, surroundings of rarely opened equipment. And if the probability for formation of an air-dust mixture is high in abnormal conditions.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Gas atmospheres</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Gas atmospheres are classified as follows according to IEC 60079-10-1 and IEC 60079-7.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Zone 0</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">An area where an explosive mixture of air and flammable gas, vapor, or particles is present continuously, for long periods, or frequently.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Zone 1</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">An area where the occasional occurrence of an explosive mixture of air and flammable gas, vapor, or particles is less likely.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Zone 2.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">An area where the occasional occurrence of an explosive mixture of air and flammable gas, vapor, or particles is not likely but rare and only short-term.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Equipment Category</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The Atex equipment groups and their classifications are divided into two groups and normal industrial use in accordance with 94/9/EC Equipment group II is divided into three categories by the equipment directive. Equipment in higher categories can be used in lower categories, but equipment in equipment group II cannot be used in equipment group I.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Equipment category 1</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Design and structure of the equipment ensure an extremely high level of safety when the operating conditions specified by the manufacturer are observed. The equipment must be able to ensure sufficient level of safety even in rare fault situations. The equipment must ensure two protection methods independent of each other and safety must be maintained even when two faults are present simultaneously. Equipment in this category are intended to be used in area classes 0 and 20 and Ga and Da.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Equipment category 2</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Design and structure of the equipment ensure a high level of safety when the operating conditions specified by the manufacturer are observed. The equipment must be able to ensure a sufficient level of safety during repeated error situations and normal equipment fault situations. Equipment in this category are intended to be used in area classes 1 and 21 and Gb and Db.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Equipment category 3</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Design and structure of the equipment ensure a normal level of safety when the operating conditions specified by the manufacturer are observed. The equipment must be able to ensure a sufficient level of safety during normal operation. Often the manufacturer’s declaration of conformity is sufficient and third-party approval is not required. Equipment in this category are intended to be used in area classes 2 and 22, and Gc and Dc.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Equipment Protection Levels (EPL)</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">IEC 60079-14 specifies an alternative way to describe zones. EPL uses risk evaluation in equipment selection.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Temperature</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Temperature groups of flammability groups refer to temperature which the equipment of protective structure surface must not reach any conditions. This temperature limit prevents the gas or vapor flash temperature from being reached. The temperature group and highest allowable surface temperature are usually determined by combined testing of the protective structure and the component.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Temperature class and maximum surface temperature</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">As per IEC 60079-0, the temperature class specifies how high the surface temperature can rise without the gas, vapor, mist, or dust reaching its flash point and exploding. The relation between the surface temperature and the distance between the heat source and the protective structure is normally linear. This assumption cannot be relied on in all cases, so the surface temperature must be determined by tests and the temperature group selected accordingly. The flash temperature of gases and vapors is generally known to a high degree of accuracy.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">A safety factor must be used when calculating the temperature of dust-air mixture and dust layers. For a dust-air mixture, the safety margin is calculated by multiplying the ignition temperature of the mixture by 0.67. When the dust layer thickness exceeds 5 mm, the safety margin is calculated by deducting 75 Kelvin from the maximum tested temperature causing a dust explosion in the atmosphere.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ex d</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Ex d protection type refers to a protection type, which withstands the explosion pressure. The protection type must be in accordance with standard IEC/EN 60079-1, which makes it suitable for Zones 1 and 2. Spark-generating components, such as relays and switches, can be installed inside the enclosure. Enclosure protection is based on suffocating the explosion inside the enclosure through grooves in the enclosure so that flammable material is not released outside. The enclosure is always manufactured of metal and only metallic Ex d approved cable glands can be used.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Typical uses are Ex d motors, switch parts of safety switches, switch parts of control switches, Ex heaters, Ex connection boxes, and Ex lighting fixtures.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The enclosure can be repaired if the protection properties do not change and if the enclosure withstands the over-pressure test after the repair. The seal materials must not be made in enclosure.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ex e</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Ex e protection type refers to an increased safety protection type. The protection type must be in accordance with standard IEC/EN 60079-7, making it suitable for Zones 1 and 2. Only intrinsically safe Ex approved components are allowed to be installed inside the enclosure. Suitability of this structure for the area class must be ensured through electrical design and technical solutions so that the equipment does not produce sparks and cannot overheat exceeding the temperature limits. An Ex e enclosure can be manufactured of either metal or plastic. Ex e or Ex d approved cable glands can be used in these enclosures.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Typical uses are Ex e motors, safety and control enclosures, Ex terminal blocks, Ex terminal block enclosures, enclosure parts of Ex lighting fixtures and Ex e bushes and sealing plugs.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The enclosure can be repaired if the sealing class and the temperature class do not change because of e.g. painting.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ex i</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Ex I protection type refers to an intrinsically safe protection type. The protection type must be in accordance with standard IEC/EN 60079-11, making it suitable for area classes 0, 1, and 2. The equipment’s electrical circuit energy must be below the dangerous minimum ignition energy (MIE) even in fault situations. In this case the power is restricted before it is transferred to the Ex area. Sparks are not generated even in short-circuit situations. It is recommended that Ex i enclosures are visually different from normal enclosures. Additionally the circuits should be color-coded and visually different from the other electrical circuits.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, Ex I equipment is used in automation systems. However, it is not suitable for large powers.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Protection class must not change when Ex I equipment is repaired. Also the surface and the air gaps must remain unchanged. Use of reserve fuses with the same value as the ones is allowed in the equipment. Diode barriers must not be repaired but they must be replaced. Internal wiring must not be modifies. Operation of the structure must be ensured after servicing by performing a one-minute voltage test with 500 V.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ex t</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Ex t protection type refers to a dust-proof enclosure. The protection type must be in accordance with standard IEC/EN 60079-31, making it suitable for area classes 0, 1, and 2. Spark-generating components, such as relays and switches, can be installed inside the enclosure. These components do not need to be approved for Ex areas. The protection type must prevent harmful amounts of dust from entering the enclosure. Entry of dust can also be completely prevented.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, Ex tD equipment is used in many industrial applications, such as control and automation systems, and it is possible that some surfaces become hot.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The condition of enclosure seals must be inspected when repairing Ex t equipment. If a seal is damaged, the seal must be changed to a new original spare part manufactured of the same material. Enclosure shock resistance must not deteriorate. Distances of fixed parts must not change in repairs. If the item being repaired is a lighting fixture, all parts used must be approved by the manufacturer and the maximum power must not be exceeded.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <strong>Primary packaging</strong> is the material that first envelops the product and holds it. This usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is the package which
                is in direct contact with the contents.</p>

            <img class="m" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 292px;" src="/images/upload/primary_packaging.jpg">


            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Secondary packaging</strong> is outside the primary packaging - usually used to group primary packages together.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tertiary packaging</strong> is used for bulk handling warehouse storage and transport shipping. The normal form is a unit load that packs tightly into containers.
                <br>These broad categories are arbitrary in nature. For example, depending on the use, a shrink wrap can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product,
                secondary packaging when combining smaller packages, and tertiary packaging on some distribution packs. A transport package or distribution package is the package
                form used to ship store and handle the product or inner packages.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">A container for pharmaceutical use is an article which holds or is intended to contain and protect a drug and is or may be in direct contact with it. The closure
                is a part of the container. The container and its closure must not interact physically or chemically with the substance within in any way that would alter its
                quality. The following are general terms used to describe pharmaceutical containers for packaging.</p>
            <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Well-closed containers must protect the contents from extraneous matter or from loss of the substance under normal conditions of handling, shipment or storage.</li>
                <li>Tightly closed containers must protect the contents from extraneous matter, from loss of the substance, and from efflorescence, deliquescence or evaporation
                    under normal conditions of handling, shipment or storage. If the container is intended to be opened on several occasions, it must be designed to be airtight
                    after reclosure.</li>
                <li>Hermetically closed containers must protect the contents from extraneous matter and from loss of the substance, and be impervious to air or any other gas under
                    normal conditions of handling, shipment or storage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Substances and dosage forms requiring protection from light should be maintained in a light-resistant container that – either by reason of the inherent properties
                of the material which it is composed, or because a special coating has been applied to it – shields the contents from the effects of light. Alternatively,
                the container may be placed inside a suitable light-resistant (opaque) covering and/or stored in a dark place.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">The peristaltic pump uses a rotor in which multiple rollers are mounted. Partially surrounding the rotor is a stationary, curved shoe or “anvil”.
                                    A flexible, hollow tube (usually silicone rubber) is pinched between each roller and the shoe. As the rotor rotates, fluid inside the tube is driven
                                    forward as the pinched portion of the tubing advances.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">The piston pump, along with the rolling diaphragm pump, may be compared to a syringe in that they both employ a moving piston inside a stationary cylinder
                                    to displace a precise amount of liquid. As the piston moves upward, liquid is forced out of the pump and when it moves downward, liquid is drawn
                                    into the pump.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">The rolling diaphragm pump uses a flexible membrane (diaphragm) attached to the pump body at its outside diameter and to the piston at its inside diameter.
                                    A space between the piston and the body internal body cylinder allows the diaphragm to be “doubled” and to “roll” as the
                                    piston moves up and down. Vacuum is applied to a port in the lower portion of the pump body to maintain the shape of the diaphragm and to pull the
                                    piston downward on the refill portion of the filling cycle. Typically, the product supply has a slight overpressure.</p>

                                    flow from the tank to the filling needle, and a clock or timing device to repeatedly control the amount of time that the valve is open.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The peristaltic pump uses a rotor in which multiple rollers are mounted. Partially surrounding the rotor is a stationary, curved shoe or “anvil”. A flexible, hollow tube (usually silicone rubber) is pinched between each roller and the shoe. As the rotor rotates, fluid inside the tube is driven forward as the pinched portion of the tubing advances.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The piston pump, along with the rolling diaphragm pump, may be compared to a syringe in that they both employ a moving piston inside a stationary cylinder to displace a precise amount of liquid. As the piston moves upward, liquid is forced out of the pump and when it moves downward, liquid is drawn into the pump.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The rolling diaphragm pump uses a flexible membrane (diaphragm) attached to the pump body at its outside diameter and to the piston at its inside diameter. A space between the piston and the body internal body cylinder allows the diaphragm to be “doubled” and to “roll” as the piston moves up and down. Vacuum is applied to a port in the lower portion of the pump body to maintain the shape of the diaphragm and to pull the piston downward on the refill portion of the filling cycle. Typically, the product supply has a slight overpressure.</p>

                            <ol style="text-align: justify;" type="a">
                            <li>Prevention of broken glass bottles.</li>
                            <li>Reduced costs and higher packaging speeds relative to other packaging materials.</li>
                            <li>Blister packaging helps retain product integrity since drugs that are prepackaged in blisters are shielded from adverse conditions.</li>
                            <li>Opportunities for product contamination are minimal.</li>
                            <li>Each dose is identified by product name, lot number and expiration date.</li>
                            <li>Individually sealed in constructions of plastic, foil and/or paper. Tamper evidence is another strength of blister packaging. Each tablet or capsule is individually protected from tampering until use.</li>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;" class="mt-3"><strong>Blister Packaging Machinery</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Modern thermoform-fill-seal machined can operate at speeds ≤ 800 packages/min. Emphasis in improving production is placed on applying microprocessor controls that electronically connect the filling and forming equipment with other downstream machinery for cartoning and wrapping. These controls also feed tablets or liquids into the unit-dose blisters, ensuring that an exact volume is put into each. Modern machinery also uses integrated vision systems to help ensure the accuracy of the fill and the integrity of the product in the blister. These machines have become quite versatile and can readily accommodate several lidstocks and basestock, allowing the manufacturer to obtain better compatibility between the medicine and its packaging material as well as better patient compliance.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The peristaltic pump uses a rotor in which multiple rollers are mounted. Partially surrounding the rotor is a stationary, curved shoe or “anvil”.
                                            A flexible, hollow tube (usually silicone rubber) is pinched between each roller and the shoe. As the rotor rotates, fluid inside the tube is driven
                                            forward as the pinched portion of the tubing advances.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The piston pump, along with the rolling diaphragm pump, may be compared to a syringe in that they both employ a moving piston inside a stationary cylinder
                                            to displace a precise amount of liquid. As the piston moves upward, liquid is forced out of the pump and when it moves downward, liquid is drawn
                                            into the pump.</p>

                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The rolling diaphragm pump uses a flexible membrane (diaphragm) attached to the pump body at its outside diameter and to the piston at its inside diameter.
                                            A space between the piston and the body internal body cylinder allows the diaphragm to be “doubled” and to “roll” as the
                                            piston moves up and down. Vacuum is applied to a port in the lower portion of the pump body to maintain the shape of the diaphragm and to pull the
                                            piston downward on the refill portion of the filling cycle. Typically, the product supply has a slight overpressure.</p>

                                            flow from the tank to the filling needle, and a clock or timing device to repeatedly control the amount of time that the valve is open.</p>

                                            near the filling needle. A simple time pressure filling system or a fill by weight system may be gravimetric. These system use a “clock”

                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gas Cylinder</strong> – usually cylindrical, suitable for compressed, liquefied or dissolved gas, fitted with a device to regulate the spontaneous outflow of gas at atmospheric pressure and room temperature.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>General case: cylinders of single gases</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Validation of the cylinder filling process is performed by a <strong><em>weighing (or double weighing) control,</em></strong> including the calculation of the mean, standard deviation and coefficients of variation, or by pressure if justified.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">This validation should ideally be presented for all types of cylinder, but at least for critical types of containers. A <strong><em>bracketing approach</em></strong> may be used as a function of the capacity, material used for construction and whether fitted with a built-in pressure regulator or a residual pressure valve. If needs be, for each type of alloy used, a single validation can be performed on one cylinder of this alloy, on the condition that this is justified.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Validation can be performed by determining the amount of gas contained in a cylinder compared with a reference cylinder filled with the charge of gas to avoid the problems of fluctuations in pressure as a function of temperature. The reproducibility of filling is also verified whatever the composition of the finished product batch (homogenous or heterogeneous).</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">For compressed gases, the temperature and pressure stabilisation time after filling which depends upon various capacities, nature of material, thermal exchange, ambient temperature (and any variation in it during the stabilisation time), rate of filling of the cylinder, airflow over the cylinder and its proximity to any adjacent filled cylinders is specified, unless otherwise justified. Cylinders, which have been returned for filling, are prepared in accordance with Annex 6 of the GMP.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The integrity of the filling system to indicate leak tightness to prevent possible contamination of the system under vacuum or an estimate of the yield accounted for losses as an annual average is provided. The tolerated limits of temperature and pressure are provided (specifying especially the hydrostatic pressure test and the bursting pressure of the cylinder). On the safety level, any problems of possible overload of compressed or liquefied gas are addressed.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Other containers for single gases</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of cylinder bundles and mobile evaporators, <strong><em>validation of the filling procedure</em></strong> is also performed by weighing or by pressure if justified.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of fixed evaporators, validation can consist of the absence of impurity enrichment due to the formation of degradation products with time, to trapping because of the temperature and to transfers from one container to another during the manufacturing process or during sampling. It is specified whether the impurities remain at the same proportions between the gaseous and liquid phases as the container is emptied. The minimal threshold for filling the fixed evaporator is specified to avoid any risk of impurity enrichment.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Analytical Procedure</strong></p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of liquefied gases, the nature of the phase (liquid or gaseous) is indicated, as is the method of sampling for the control. In the case of impurities that are preferentially present in the gaseous phase and eliminated to a large extent during the first drawing off (e.g. nitric oxide in medical nitrous oxide), the order of analyses is specified.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Medicinal gases are often packaged in a wide range of containers:</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; − compressed gas cylinders,</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; − liquefied gas cylinders, with or without a dip tube,</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; − cylinder bundle,</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; − mobile evaporator,</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; − fixed evaporator,</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; − mobile cryogenic container,</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; − fixed cryogenic container.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">A variety of reference codes exist, depending on the supplier, capacity and material, particularly in the case of cylinders. For each reference and each capacity, the water capacity of the container (in L), the amount of gaseous product released at 1atm and 15°C (in m3), and the weight of product stored (in g for compressed gases or in kg for liquefied gases) are provided, together with the accepted deviations. For liquefied gas cylinders, the pressure remains constant then falls suddenly at the end of use. Therefore, only the weight monitors the state of filling. The filling pressure (at 15° C) is justified in comparison with the weight formula.</p>

Insulin is a hormone used to treat patients who have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). It is supplied as a premixed liquid measured in standardized units of potency rather than by weight or volume. These standardized units are called USP units, which are often shortened to units. The most commonly prepared concentration of insulin is 100 units per milliliter, which is referred to as units 100 insulin and is abbreviated as U-100 on insulin labels.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tuberculin syringe</strong> - is calibrated in hundredths of a milliliter. Because there are 100 lines on the syringe, each line represents 0.01 mL. This syringe is used for intradermal injection of very small amounts of substances in tests for tuberculosis and allergies, as well as for intramuscular injection of small quantities of medication. The tuberculin syringe is the preferred syringe for use in measuring medications less than 1 mL.</li>

Vacuum is applied to a port in the lower portion of the pump body to maintain the shape of the diaphragm and to pull the piston downward on the refill portion of the filling cycle. Typically, the product supply has a slight overpressure.</p></li>

                <h3>Secondary Packaging for Pharmaceuticals</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Secondary packaging components are identified by the FDA as serving one or more of the following functions:</p>
                <ol style="text-align: justify;" type="a">
                <li>provide protection from excessive transmission of moisture or solvents into or out of the packaging system.</li>
                <li>provide protection from excessive transmission of reactive gases (atmospheric oxygen, inert headspace filler as, or other organic vapors) into or out of the packaging system.</li>
                <li>provide light protection for the packaging system.</li>
                <li>provide protection for a packaging system that is flexible or needs extra protection from rough handling.</li>
                <li>provide an additional measure of microbiological protection (e.g., by maintain sterility or by protecting the packaging system from microbial intrusion)</li>
                </ol>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Since secondary packaging components are not intended to make contact with the dosage form of the product, they are regulated somewhat differently than primary container closure components. In a new drug application, emphasis is typically placed on the primary components. If the secondary packaging component is specifically intended to provide extra safety measures to the product, such as safety device attached to a syringe, complete information about the packaging material should be provided, including proof that packaging material is quite permeable, such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), the packaging could be considered a potential source of contamination. Permeable packaging materials, in some cases, can facilitate migration of ink or adhesive materials, which can harm the product.</p>
                <p class="mt-3"><strong>Overwrapping and Flow Wrapping</strong></p>
                <div class="rows">
                <ul style="text-align: justify;" type="circle" class="list-circle">
                <li>Also known as “fin seal wrapping”, “fin sealing”, “cello wrapping” or even “flow wrapping”.</li>
                <li>The process uses an oriented polypropylene film, commonly referred to as cellophane. Items are packaged in high speed runs that can exceed 200 pieces per minute. To maximize output, state of the art horizontal pouch packaging machines are utilized.</li>
                <li>Machines uses conveyors to keep pace with product feeding, which can be done manually, automatically, or through a semi-automatic approach. Individual items are first wrapped in propylene film, and then a fin-seal is created to run along the length of each package. The packaging material is of a tubular orientation, so once each item is secured within the cellophane tube, it must be cut to length, before an end-seal is created.</li>
                <li>The resulting package leaves each item loosely encased in its own tamper resistant enclosure. Where appropriate, hang holes can be added to fin-seal pouches to increase retail display flexibility.</li>
                <li>Flow-wrapping is cost-effective since the process employs high-speed technology that is designed for high-quantity output.</li>
                <li>Pouch material can be clear or opaque, and can be custom printed or left unadorned. In addition to cello-wrapping, fin sealing is appropriate for use with some styles of foil packaging materials.</li>
                <li>Additional barriers can be incorporated into fin-seal packages to address moisture and vapor control requirements.</li>
                <li>Horizontal pouch packaging solutions are available to suit a wide range of contents. Irregularly shaped items and products with sharp corners benefit from additional protection provided by thicker gauge materials.</li>

                <ul style="text-align: justify;" type="circle" class="list-circle">
                <li>Cartoning machines are packaging systems which erect, close and/or erect, fill and close carton blanks or folded and side seams sealed cartons.</li>
                <li>Cartons can come in the form of blanks, which are flat, pre-printed and cut to size and shape, with slots and tabs pre-cut if necessary. These are then folded or ‘erected’ to form the carton in the machine.</li>
                <li>Cartons are made from carton-board which is a semi-flexible paper material with 250 µ to 1000µ in thickness.</li>
                <li>Cartons can come in a wide variety of shapes including hinged lids, triangular, hexagonal, octagonal, double-wall, wave-shaped cartons, and tapered trays.</li>
                <li>Cartoning machine can be semi-automatic machines which close the flaps of manually erected and filled cartons at low speeds, but some more sophisticated machines incorporates pick-and-place product loading or stacking devices, leaflet inserters and coding devices and run at several hundred cartons a minute.</li>
                <li>Modern cartoning machine have benefited from the introduction of subassemblies, programmable logic controllers and even computers which allow the machines to change the size automatically and synchronized using software rather than mechanical transmission components.</li>

                <li>The cleaning of the process machines will be mainly carried out by CIP (Clean in Place) systems. Depending on the sensitivity of the product being produced, the equipment may be cleaned aseptically and therefore eliminating any possible contamination from outside.</li>
                <li>Sterilizing machines can be also called, autoclaves and retorts. There are three main types of sterilizing machines; static, rotary and pilot or laboratory systems.</li>

                <li>There is a whole range of machines and equipment carrying out these functions, from simple mechanical stamps or overprinters to sophisticated ink jet and laser coders applying computer generated data. These machines are usually attached to a larger packaging machine such as cartoning machine, filler or wrapper.</li>
                <li>Modern ink jet and laser coders can be programmed to carry a large amount of variable information such as lot number, date code; sequential coding based on a unique serial number which is recorded in a secure database. A range of styles, typefaces and characters sizes can be uses and changed easily especially in comparison with older mechanical devices.</li>
                <li>Sophisticated software means coders can be programmed to create a different mark for every product to create a track-and-trace feature on a pack. This helps to prevent counterfeiting. Track-and-trace features can also be used to ease product recall, monitor product quality and track products internally. Examples include sequential or non-sequential codes, a covert code or a machine-readable code.</li>

                <li><strong>Conveyors</strong>&nbsp;are machines and equipment which carry ingredients, products, containers, packs or packaging components from one place to another.</li>
                <li>There are a large number of different types of conveyor, designed to convey different types of product or to perform particular tasks. They can be divided into four main groups:
                <ol type="square">
                <li>Conveyors for bulk products e.g. powders or free flowing solids</li>

                </ol>
                </li>
                <li>In their simplest form&nbsp;<strong>conveyors</strong>&nbsp;are mechanical assemblies which can be demountable and easy to move. In their most sophisticated form conveyors can be complex machines with drives, controls and sensors. In this form they undertake complex tasks or those needing highly accurate sorting, ordering or distribution of the items or products being conveyed.</li>
                <li>Common forms of belt and slat band&nbsp;<strong>conveyors</strong>&nbsp;are used for all types of semi-automated or automated processing and packaging functions. They facilitate different requirements during production, and enable different products and packaging functions to be handled.</li>
                <li>Some machines, such as large bakery ovens, include conveyors as part of the process, while high speed wrapping machines require in-feed and out-feed conveyors to be built in to operate at the speeds required.</li>
                <li>Different consistencies of products, (soft, delicate, sticky, hot, chilled, frozen), require different handling techniques and so different designs of conveyor.</li>
                <li>The ability to clean conveyors is an important requirement particularly in food or pharmaceutical plants where rigorous clean-in-place and wash-in-place regimes exist. These conveyors are often made of wire mesh, plastic mesh or stainless-steel and some can be dismantled or moved for ease of cleaning.</li>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Automated syringe blister packaging machines allow syringes to be fed onto an assembly line and evenly spaced out. The machine places the syringes into plastic preformed blister trays. The cover film is then applied to the top of the blister pack and sealed. Some blister packaging machines are also equipped with the ability to apply labels to the blisters or the film cover. Tray pack machines function in a similar way – syringes are loaded and seal the syringes inside. Alternatively the tray can be packaged into a plastic or cardboard, which can then be labeled.</p>

            <h3>Disposables - Single Use System for Aseptic Processing and Filling Operations</h3>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Single-use components and systems, often called disposables, are typically made from plastic or elastomeric materials and are designed to replace metallic components in process operations. Single-use components are designed to be discarded after one use.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Many disposable systems are supplied to the user pre-cleaned and sterilized so item preparation before use is not necessary. This eliminates the need for cleaning and sterilization operations at the customer site. Sterilization of single-use systems is commonly performed by suppliers using gamma radiation, which is the same progress used for implantable medical devices. The single-use industry is to validate the manufacturing and sterilization systems according to medical device regulations. Alternative sterilization methods can include hydrogen peroxide, ethylene oxide, or autoclaving.</p>
            <p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Common single-use process components</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Filter capsules</strong> – air filtration, vessel air inlet and vent, media and buffer filtration, cell harvest, product filtration and product concentration.</li>
              <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Flexible tubing</strong> – liquid and product transfer, process sampling, CIP/SIP</li>
              <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bags</strong> – Media and buffer preparation, liquid and product storage, mixing systems, bioreactors, process sampling, product freezing and shipping</li>
              <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fittings</strong> – Sanitary piping and tubing connections, Tees, Ys, elbows in tubing</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">There are two primary factors for using single use systems in bioprocess operations. The first factor is the high capital and operating costs of specialized process equipment and facilities. Operation of stainless steel equipment is also expensive due to costs associated with cleaning, sterilization, validation, calibration and maintenance. Conversion to disposable equivalents often reduces overall operating costs.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The second factor is related to the increasing potency of biotech products. As product development technology and methods improve, product specificity to decrease state has increased. The diseases targeted, like cancer and autoimmune diseases, have become more critical.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Potent drug processing poses two problems. One is that the potent drugs are dangerous to operators and the environment, and therefore need to be contained. The second is that the potent drugs are difficult to remove from hard surfaces e.g., stainless steel.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Systems Used in Single- Used System/Materials</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The typical filling equipment product is constructed primarily of 316 L stainless steel. Operation of these stainless system requires cleaning and sterilization operations prior to use. After use, the product path must be disassembled for offline cleaning and autoclaving of the product contact parts. System disassembly also increases the chance of leakage and subsequent product contamination when piping is misaligned or connections loosened. Online, automated CIP and sterilization in place (SIP) operations can be used to supplement or replace manual cleaning.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Disposable product path components are commonly used in filling operations</em></strong>. Tubing is used on the filling system product inlet line to the dosing system. It is also used to carry product between dosing pumps and filling needles. In fact, flexible tubing is required for systems in which the dosing pumps are stationary and the needles have movement. Filling needles can have significant vertical travel during bottom-up filling operations.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Tubing material for product application varies depending on the type of dosing system used. Flexible tubing materials such as silicone are commonly used on the outlet of positive displacement dosing systems like piston pumps and rolling diaphragm pumps. Silicone is also the most common tubing used for peristaltic pump dosing systems, where both flexibility and durability are required. Rigid tubing like Teflon® is used in time pressure dosing systems between the flow orifice (sometimes called a throttle valve) and filling needle. The relative volume change is great enough to affect the accuracy of product dosed in time pressure systems, particularly when the dose volumes are low.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Filling line equipment is commonly dedicated entirely to a single product because of cross contamination issues. Most filling lines today support multi-drug operations. Traditional multi drug operations. Traditional multi-drug operations require validation of the level of product carryover after cleaning operations to ensure subsequent products are not contaminated. Certain product-contact parts are hard to clean to acceptable levels, and are therefore dedicated to specific products.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">An alternative to filling equipment dedication is the use of single-use parts and assemblies. These systems can include components like bulk product bags, capsule filters, silicone tubing, and other plastic fittings and parts. These parts can already be purchased pre-cleaned and pre-sterilized, and double or triple bagged for easy use within cleanrooms. Filling operations are critical enough to require entire single-use systems to be assembled and sterilized together rather than having to piece individual components together at the point of use. The dosing system used for filling also affects the characteristics of the single-use components.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Peristaltic dosing</em></strong> is ideally suited for disposables, as peristaltic tubing is used for much of the product path. Single-use peristaltic systems are typically comprised of a product hold bag, supply tubing and a filling needle that are bagged together and sterilized using gamma irradiation. The assembly is removed from the bag and connected to the filling system, which can be as simple as a single peristaltic pump, immediately before use. High quality peristaltic pumps can be very precise at dosing water-like solutions at slower speeds. However, accuracy is directly influenced by the tubing. The tubing that is located in the pump head changes shape over time as a result of wear, so accuracy drift is common. Characterizing and compensating for the drift is required. Peristaltic pumps also dose at slower speeds, which means that high speed peristaltic systems require more pump heads to dose at the same rate as the equivalent piston, time pressure or rolling diaphragm systems.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Gravimetric dosing</em></strong> uses optical sensors to dose a given volume based on a calculation of the interior volume of a given length of tubing or glass. The entire product calculation path is supplied as a single-use, pre-sterilized assembly. Accuracy and precision of the system with water-like solutions is comparable to other dosing systems.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The current single use, pre-sterilized dosing systems are based on scaling up technologies designed and used for small-scale filling operations. The three most common commercial systems are <strong><em>piston pumps, rolling diaphragm pumps, and time pressure dosing</em></strong>. All three of these systems would require significant technical improvements and modifications to be converted to disposable use.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Piston pumps</strong> rely on a precise physical tolerance between the pump body and piston to provide dosing accuracy and to ensure product does not leak during use. Pump bodies and pistons are commonly matched when they are fabricated to ensure they do not gall during use. Piston pumps that are exclusively used in pharmaceutical industry are made of stainless steel. Neither material can be used to make a disposable pump due to high cost of manufacture. Plastic components are an alternative, but cannot be fabricated to the correct tolerances to ensure accuracy.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>rolling diaphragm pump</strong> is comprised mostly of stainless steel pump with a diaphragm. Dosing occurs by actuating a piston that is attached to the diaphragm, hence it is the only part that keeps the product from the contact with the piston and other internal components.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Time pressure systems</strong> are designed to dispense using a pressurized product supply and timed valve openings. A portion of the product path from the product supply manifold to the filling nozzles is made of elastomeric tubing. This tubing is used in association with an automatic tubing pinch mechanism to create the valve.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">A limitation to all current single-use pre-sterilized dosing systems is the plastic filling needle. The current plastic needles are not designed for commercial filling operations. Most are too wide to penetrate small containers and/or are too short to perform bottom up filling. Bottom up filling, where the filling needle penetrates the container opening and is drawn out during dosing, is common with high speed filling to reduce product splash and foaming. The plastic needles are also not shaped to fit correctly within needle holders on common commercial filling systems. Custom fixtures are required to use them on existing machines.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">High speed filling requires needles made to very tight tolerances, particularly in diameter, as this has an influence on dosing accuracy and precision. As high speed needles travel during and after dispensing, needle drip between doses has to be eliminated. Precise needle opening size and opening shape is also required. Substituting plastic needles with ones made from stainless steel can solve most of these issues, but it is too expensive for single-use assemblies.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">This test is used only with containers that have been exposed to sulphur dioxide fumes under controlled humidity conditions. Such treatment neutralizes the surface alkali. The glass becomes chemically more resistant. The principle involved in the water attack test is to determine whether the alkali leached from the surface of a container is within the specified limits or not. Since the inner surface is under test the entire container has to be used. The amount of acid that is necessary to neutralize the released alkali from the surface is estimated, the leaching of alkali is accelerated using elevated temperature for a specified time. Methyl red indicator is used to determine the end point.</p>

                            <li>When glassware is stored for several months, especially in a damp atmosphere or with extreme temperature variations, the wetting of the surface by condensed moisture (condensation) results in salts being dissolved out of the glass. This is called <em>“blooming”</em> or <em>“weathering”</em> &amp; it gives the appearance of fine crystals on the glass.</li>
                            <li>Type II containers are made of commercial soda-lime glass that has been de-alkalized or treated to remove surface alkali.</li>
                            <li>The&nbsp; de-alkalizing&nbsp; process&nbsp; is&nbsp; known&nbsp; as&nbsp; <em>“sulfur&nbsp; treatment”</em>&nbsp; and&nbsp; virtually&nbsp; prevents “weathering” of empty bottles.</li>
                            <li>Some manufactures expose the glass to an atmosphere containing water vapor &amp; acidic gases. This results in a reaction between gases &amp; surface alkali, which makes it resistant to attack by water.</li>
                            <li>The alkali removed from the glass appears on the surface as a sulfate bloom, which is removed when the containers are washed before filling.</li>

                <p>Weighing and dispensing activities are processes of transferring specific amounts of powder or liquid raw materials from the bulk container and into smaller units that will be dispensed in specific quantities for batch manufacture. These two unit operations can be seen inside a warehouse during bulk product manufacture, or in a pharmacy during small-scale compounding processes.
                <br>
                <br>

                These are two common yet very critical activities in pharmaceutical industries as they set up the foundation of the final drug product. This is the stage where amounts of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and the excipients must be precisely measured according to the recipe indicated. In a pharmaceutical plant, the operators normally follow the step by step procedure in the Batch Manufacturing Record (BMR) and afterwards, sends it out to the production team. A small amount of the raw materials will also be set aside for Quality Control; this is to guarantee that quality is embedded from beginning of production.
                <br>
                <br>
                Meanwhile, in a pharmacy setting, compounding recipe will depend on individual patient information and their medication regimen. In both scenarios, strict adherence to the formulation recipe is necessary to ensure the production of safe and efficient pharmaceutical dosage forms.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since these activities are usually handling substances in bulk form, they are at high risk for incidents of spills, leaks, and hazardous volatile emissions. Also, it is very likely that these activities will cater to concentrated substances which may have unwanted adverse health effects to operators exposed for a prolonged period of time. They may even cause contamination to the surrounding environment. To prevent this, engineering control measures – primary (equipment) and secondary (cleanroom facility) – must be present to provide a good ventilation flow and suppress the formation of fumes and/or dust clouds. As per international guidelines, such can be achieved with an equipment using unidirectional laminar air flow with specific pressurization controls and airflow velocity.
                <br>
                <br>
                For industries that handle chemical substances with explosive properties, an ATEX zone must be specified by an ATEX specialist. This ATEX rated zone must then be considered when designing the facilities and choosing the equipment for weighing and dispensing operations.
                <br>
                <br>
                As part of guideline development surrounding pharmaceutical companies, it is important to have a data logging or tracing of actual process events. Different equipment used for weighing and dispensing therefore, upholds this requirement by integrating human machine interfaces (HMI) which can be connected to each company’s supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems.
                <br>
                <br>
                From weighing scales to actual equipment used to contain the powder or liquid substances handled, modern designs allow for such data logging.
                <br>
                <br>
                Esco Pharma is equipped with an experienced team of engineers who designed a number of equipment for weighing and dispensing activities of pharmaceutical industries. These equipment provide the necessary protection for users, product, and the environment to prevent any possible cross-contamination and exposure during the handling of different pharmaceutical substances. </p>

            <p>Granulation is the process of creating granules by combining one or more powder particulates through compression activities and/or with a binding agent. In this process primary powder particles are made to adhere to form larger multi-particle entities called granules. Pharmaceutical granules typically have a size range between 0.2 and 4.0 mm, depending on the subsequent use of the granules. Formed granules then allow the products and excipients to be easily moulded as a tablets or part of capsule manufacture. Since these two are the most common drug dosage forms, granulation is one of the most important unit operations in drug manufacturing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Granules which are used as a dosage form consists of powder particles that have been aggregated to form a larger particle, which is usually 2-4 mm in diameter, sufficiently resistant to withstand handling. This is much larger than granules prepared as an intermediate for tablet manufacture.
            <br>
            <br>
            Granulation normally commences after initial dry mixing of the necessary powdered ingredients so that a uniform distribution of each ingredient through the mix is achieved. After granulation, the granules will either be packed (when used as a dosage form) or they may be mixed with other excipients prior to tablet compaction or capsule filling.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Advantages of granules:</strong>
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Prevents powder segregation:</strong> prevents weight variation possibilities.</li>

            <li><strong>Enhances powder flowability:</strong> higher flowability provides better filling to the dies.</li>

            <li><strong>Produces uniform mixtures:</strong> prevents segregation during transport or handling as it ensures similarity in particle size, shape, and density.</li>

            <li><strong>Produces dust-free formulations:</strong> this characteristic also reduces possible occupational exposure to the drug product.</li>

            <li><strong>Eliminates poor content uniformity</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Improves compaction characteristics of the mixture</strong></li>

            </ul>
            <br>

            <p><strong>Methods of Granulation</strong>

            <br>

            <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

                <li><strong>Dry Granulation:</strong> Dry granulation converts primary powder particles into granules using the application of pressure without the intermediate use of liquid. It therefore avoids heat/ temperature combinations which may cause degradation of the product for APIs and excipients sensitive to moisture and heat. In order to form granules, compacting and densifying powders is done via:
                <br>
                <br>

                <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li>
                    <strong>Slugging:</strong> This is an old process that is being replaced by the modern roller compaction. In this, dry powders can be compacted using a convectional tablet machine or a large heavy-duty rotary press.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Atablet press machine uses a mechanical device that compresses powders into tablets of uniform size, shape, and weight containing the same quantity of API and excipients. It is comprised of two punches and a die, wherein the upper and lower punches come together in the die which contains the tablet formulation.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Meanwhile, the use of a large or heavy-duty rotary press, normally referred to as slugging, creates compacts typically 25 mm diameter in size (by about 10-15 mm thick); better known as ‘slugs’. However, many pharmaceutical tableting materials suffer from ‘work hardening’ which results in poor recompaction of these already compacted granules.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><strong>Roller compactor:</strong> consistently and uniformly deliver powders between two pressure rollers where they are compacted into a ribbon or small pellets. It is composed of three major units: the feeding system (converts powder to the compaction area), the compaction unit (powder is compacted between two counter rotating rolls via applying force), and the size reduction unit (mils the ribbons to desired particle size).
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    This is an alternative gentler method wherein the powder mix is squeezed between two counter-rotating rollers to form a compressed sheet. The roller rotation speeds can be adjusted to allow variation in the compression time as the material passes between the rollers.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Additionally, roller pressure can be adjusted and maintained during a run via a hydraulic control system to yield resulting granules of constant crushing strength.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The sheet formed is normally weak and brittle and breaks immediately into flakes, and these need gentler treatment to break them into granules.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Some advantages of the roller compaction process are:
                    <ul>
                    <li>The process is economical as it dispenses with the intermediate stages of wet massing and drying, and thus the associated energy and other processing cost</li>

                    <li>It can cope with a wide range of materials, particle size, bulk density and flowability. However, experience has shown that not all materials respond to roller compaction as they do not possess suitable deformation or cohesion properties</li>

                    <li>The process is easily scaled up</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <br>

            <li><strong>Wet Granulation:</strong> very applicable to most formulations which causes aggregation of particles. This happens by incorporating a liquid solution with a binder into the powders (via granulating fluid). Such liquid must be non-toxic and volatile so that it can be removed via drying process.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this method, once a wet mass is formed, it will be forced through a sieve to produce wet granules which will afterwards be subjected to drying and screening processes; this will allow breakage of formed agglomerates of granules.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since direct compression is not applicable for a number of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the market, wet granulation is still the preferred method.<br>
            <br>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                   <li><strong>High-shear Wet Granulation:</strong> In comparison to older shear granulators, high-shear wet granulation processing makes use of efficient high-speed mixer/granulators.
                   <br>
            In the traditional shear or planetary granulation process, there should be a separate, initial, dry-powder blending operation using different powder-mixing equipment. However, this older process suffered from a number of major disadvantages such as:
            <br>
            <br>

            <ul>
            <li>Longer duration</li>
            <li>Need for several pieces of equipment</li>

            <li>High material losses incurred during transfer stages between the different equipment</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The process served the industry well for many years but with the advantages of modern mixer/granulators, pharmaceutical companies were compelled to take the next best step.</li></ul></li>


            </ul>

            <br>

            The different unit operations composing the granulation process may give rise to possible generation of airborne particulates, but modern designs offer granulators with varying containment mechanisms. For handling hazardous substances with high <a href="/solutions/oel-oeb"><strong class="color-primary">OEL</strong></a> levels, integrating granulators with barrier technologies is the ultimate solution. This design will reduce emission and promote operator, product, and environmental protection. Modern technologies also allow the integration of other mechanical equipment such as elevated platforms, lift tables, and drum tippers/lifters, to assist workers during heavy lifting activities.

            Drying is the process of removing the presence of solvents (i.e. water or other liquids) in a formulation with the presence of heat. The final product of this unit operation is a dry solid mass or powders. This process is widely used in the pharmaceutical field, from research and development phase until large-scale manufacture.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to have a good understanding of this process’ impact on the quality attributes of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in order to guarantee it will not have any adverse impact on the drug’s safety and efficiency, thus, providing high quality final products.
            <br>
            <br>
            All drying processes of relevance to pharmaceutical manufacturing involve evaporation or sublimation of the liquid phase and the removal of the subsequent vapour.
            </p>

            <br>

            <strong >Different Methods of Drying</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

            <li><p><strong>Drying of Wet Solids:</strong> Convective Drying of Wet Solids: This method utilizes dynamic convective dryers (e.g., Fluidized-bed dryer) to obtain good contact between the warm drying air and wet particles in the fluidized-bed dryer.</p>

            <p>The fluidized-bed dryer was developed for the process of fluidization to improve the efficiency of heat transfer and vapor removal, as compared with the older static tray dryers. This fluidized-bed dryer also allows the efficient transfer of the latent heat of evaporation from the air and into the drying solid.</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Advantages of fluidized-bed drying:</strong></p>


            <ul>
            <li>Shortens drying time via the efficient heat and mass transfer, allowing high product output with small footprint.</li>

            <li>Minimizes heat challenge to thermolabile materials</li>

            <li>The turbulence in a fluidized bed causes some gnaws the surface of the granule, thus, producing a more spherical free-flowing product.
            <br>
            <br>

            <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">

            <li> <strong>Conductive Drying of Wet Solids:</strong> In this process, the wet solid is in thermal contact with a hot surface and the bulk of heat transfer occurs by conduction.


            <br>
            <br>
            A good example is the vacuum oven, though it is not used as extensively as before. The vacuum oven consists of a strongly constructed jacketed vessel that can withstand a vacuum within the oven and possibly steam pressure in the jacket. Moreover, the supports for the shelves form part of the jacket, giving a larger area for conduction heat transfer.


            <br>
            <br>
            The main advantage of a vacuum oven is that drying takes place in a low temperature with minimum oxidation risk due to only a small amount of air present. Although the overall temperature of the drying solid can rise to the steam or heating water condition, it is not usually harmful.

            <br>
            <br>

            Vacuum ovens are rarely used nowadays for production but for thermolabile materials, using such equipment may be the only viable option.
            <br>
            <br>

            </li>


            <li><strong>Radiation Drying of Wet Solids:</strong> This process allows heat transmission through radiation. This method differs from heat transfer by conduction or convection such that, no transfer medium (solid, liquid or gaseous) is present during the drying process. Instead, this method takes advantage of heat energy’s ability, in the form of radiation, to cross empty space and virtually travel through the atmosphere without loss. Once this energy falls on a body capable of absorbing it, heat appears; although a proportion may be reflected or transmitted.
            <br>
            <br>

            Microwave radiation in the wavelength range 10 mm to 1 m has been found to be an efficient heating and drying method, as such, these dryers are used in the pharmaceutical industry.

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><strong>Advantages of microwave drying includes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Rapid drying at fairly low temperature</li>

            <li>Highly efficient equipment</li>

            <li>GMP compliant design</li>
            <br>
            </ul>

            Certain disadvantages for microwave drying involves the need for radiation shielding in order to prevent organ (eyes and testes) damage. However, the use of ‘fail-safe’ devices guarantee operator protection as this ensures microwave generation is prevented until the drying chamber is sealed.
            </li></ul></li>
            <br>
            <br>
            </ul>




            </li>


            <li> <strong>Drying for Solutions and Suspensions</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Main objective for this process is to create a large surface area, with the liquid, that will allow heat and mass transfer; this provides an efficient way to collect the dry solid particles.


            <br>
            <br>
            Spray drying is the most useful method for drying solutions and suspensions as it disperses the liquid to a spray of small droplets. This operation uses a spray dryer which atomizes the liquid into smaller droplets, thus, creating a large surface area for heat and mass transfer. These are sprayed into a stream of hot air, so that each droplet dries to an individual solid particle. Thus particle formation and drying occurs.

            <br>
            <br>

            Spray drying can be used for almost any substance in solution or in suspension. However, it is most beneficial for thermolabile materials – especially if continuous handling of large quantities of the substance, is required.
            <br>
            <br>


            A development in spray drying is the use of fluidized spray dryer. This is composed of a small fluidized bed that is mounted at the base of the cone – the point where the product is collected. The presence of moving air in the fluidized bed dryer, overcomes any cohesion of spray-dried particles after they fall into the collection chamber. Thus, allowing handling of spheres with higher moisture content; even those substances that are stickier and more cohesive than were previously possible to process. Examples of both soluble and insoluble substances that are spray dried include citric acid, gelatin, starch, and calcium phosphate.


            <br>
            <br>
            The process is also used for some powdered antibiotic formulations where the spray-dried powder is packaged and distributed. This is then reconstituted as a syrup at the time of dispensing.

            <br>
            <br>

            Spray drying is also capable of producing spherical particles in the respirable range of 1-7μm that are necessary for the delivery of drugs from dry powder inhalers.
            <br>
            <br>

            </li>
            <li><strong> Freeze Drying</strong>

            <br>
            <br>

            Freeze drying is a process used to dry extremely heat-sensitive materials as it allows drying without the excessive damage to substances such as: proteins, blood products, and even microorganisms (with a small significant viability).

            <br>
            <br>

            In this unit operation the initial liquid solution or suspension is frozen through the process of sublimation; the phenomenon that causes direct vaporization and condensation of a solid without the need to form an intermediate liquid phase. This is done by reducing the pressure above the frozen state.

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>Advantages of the Freeze Drying process:</strong><ul>
            <br>

            <li>Minimized chemical decomposition by inhibiting enzyme action since drying takes place at very low temperatures.</li>

            <li>Minimized oxidation as the process takes place under high vacuum with little contact with air.</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            </li>
            </ul>

            Packaging of freeze-dried products must ensure protection from moisture during storage. Container closures must ensure no contact with the atmosphere, example of which is the sealing of ampoules while still under vacuum. Otherwise, the closing must be carried out under controlled atmospheric conditions. Take note that the dry material often needs to be STERILE.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are different methods of drying, the use of which are dependent on the specific characteristics of the APIs and excipients that will be used in the formulation or manufacture of the final drug product.
            <br>
            <br>
            Different dryer technologies also come with design variations, including containment and control of possible vapor and dust generation. For contained dryers, it is important to understand the nature of substances to be handled as some may pose explosion incidents and therefore should have an ATEX rated or explosion proof venting or overall mechanical design.
            <br>
            <br>
            Barrier technologies to enclose the drying process may also be employed. Modern technologies allow the integration of other mechanical equipment that can assist workers during heavy lifting activities.

            <p>The dimension or particle size uniformity of solid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and excipients are also critical parameters in the production of highly safe and efficient final drug dosage forms. This can be achieved through the process of milling, which is a critical unit operation that controls the particle size uniformity of a pharmaceutical drug product and therefore helps produce free-flowing powders.
            <br>
            <br>

            Particle size reduction is also called comminution, and generally it is carried out to promote the efficient processing of solid particles by facilitating powder mixing (production of suspensions).
            <br>
            <br>

            Some special functions of size reduction includes: exposing cells in plant tissue prior to API extraction; or reducing the bulk volume of a material to improve transportation efficiency.
            <br>
            <br>

            It must be noted that in particle size uniformity, using different mills can give rise to different end-products from the same starting material, such that they would differ in the particle shape and proportion of fines in the final dosage form.
            <p>
            <br>

            <p><strong>Advantages of Milling Process:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Uniform mixing process</li>

            <li>Wet granule milling produces uniform and efficient drying</li>

            <li>Increased surface area to improve dissolution rate</li>

            <li>Content uniformity is assured in final dosage form</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Prior to milling, the physical properties of API and its excipients must be reviewed for possible hazards involving high OEL levels, volatility, and explosion properties, as these will help in designing the most suitable milling equipment and possible barrier technology for the process.</p>

           <p> Pharmaceutical products generally contain a number of raw materials or excipients along with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). This ensures that the final dosage form is stable and will work effectively in the body according to its mechanism of action and in its correct target site.
           <br>
            <br>
            Since drug products contain a number of components, blending or mixing them is also a critical unit operation in the manufacturing process. Blending helps ensure that the API and excipients are evenly distributed in the formulation with an even appearance. Moreover, this method helps ensure that the final drug dosage form is released/metabolized at the correct site, at the desired rate.
            <br>
            <br>
            The unit operation of blending is therefore involved in the production of practically every pharmaceutical preparation -- even if only on some stages of manufacture.
            <br>
            <br>
            Below is a list of drug dosage forms in need of the blending process:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Tablets</li>

            <li>Capsules</li>

            <li>Sachets</li>

            <li>Emulsions and creams (mixture of immiscible liquids)</li>

            <p>The word ‘capsule’ is derived from the Latin capsula, meaning a small box. As a drug dosage form, the word refers to a formulation with an edible outer packaging made from gelatin or other suitable material. This capsule is then filled with medicine to produce a unit drug dosage form that is mainly for oral use.</p>

            <p><strong>Two general types of capsules:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>hard: two-piece</li>

            <li>soft: one-piece</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Hard gel capsule filling</strong></p>

            <p>Hard capsule consists of two main cylindrical-shaped pieces that closes at one end.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>‘Cap’: refers to the shorter piece that fits over the open end of the longer piece.</li>

            <li>‘Body’: refers to the longer piece</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The hard capsules are made in a range of fixed sizes that can be filled with a large variety of materials of different physiochemical properties.</p>

            <br>
            <center><img src="/images/upload/hard-capsule-filling-process.jpg"></center>
            <center><p><em><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Hard Capsule Filling Process</em></p></center>

            <br>

            <p>Whether capsules are being filled on the bench for extemporaneous dispensing or on high-speed automatic machines for industrial products, the same set of basic operations are carried out.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of filling methods available, the major differences between them lies on how the dose of material is measured into the capsule body.</p>

            <br>


            <p><strong>Softgel filling</strong></p>

            <p>In terms of formulation requirements, the softgel can be considered as a biphasic dosage form with its solid-phase capsule shell and liquid phase capsule fill matrix.</p>

            <p>Although it is possible to incorporate a drug in the softgel’s shell, a number of final drug products have the active ingredient(s) within the liquid-phase fill matrix. This matrix is made from a wide range of materials with different physiochemical properties.</p>

            <p>Large-scale manufacture of liquid fill capsules is possible with the invention of the rotary die encapsulation machine. The rotary die process involves the continuous formation of a heat seal between two ribbons of gelatin concurrent with filling the softgel capsule according to the required dose. Throughout the years, even with the improvement of manufacturing processes, the basic principle for this unit operation remains.</p>

            <p>The encapsulation process requires a certain amount of containment during filling of the hard and softgel capsules. Large amounts of concentrated powder and liquid APIs and their excipients, are utilized in the formulation, which may give rise to unwanted dust clouds or volatile substances in the atmosphere. To improve final drug product quality and prevent unwanted personnel and environmental exposure, certain primary engineering controls with proper ventilation and containment measures are critical in the manufacturing process.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            This unit operation is critical in the manufacture of tablets, as these dosage forms are prepared by forcing the raw materials – active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients - with each other. A porous, solid specimen of defined geometry is then produced.
            <br>
            <br>
            Compression takes place in a die by the action of two punches, the lower and the upper, by which the compressive force is applied.
            <br>
            <br>
            Production time and cost are also two driving aspects in the pharmaceutical industry, and it is always critical to prepare a manufacturing method that will decrease the two while increasing assurance of quality, safety, and efficiency. An obvious way to achieve this is to minimize the number of operations involved in the pre-treatment of the powder mixture before tableting. By using the direct compression method, only two operations are necessary: powder mixing and tableting.</p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Advantages of direct compression:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Reduced production cost</li>

            <li>Enhanced product stability (heat and water are not involved in the process)</li>

            <li>Faster tablet disintegration and drug dissolution time</li>
            </ul>
            <br>


            <p><strong>Different Direct Compression Techniques:</strong></p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li><strong>Direct compression with induced die feeders</strong>
            <br>

             - Uses special feed device which enhances the flowability of powders: from the hopper into the die cavity of the tablet press. The die feeder reduces presence of air in the powder blend which makes the fill powder denser, thus, easily compacted.</li>

             <li><strong>Direct compression with induced dry binders</strong>
             <br>

             - Binders used here must have cohesive or compressibility properties to form a final drug product with the hardness and friability compliant with formulation standards.</li>

             <li><strong>Direct compression excipients</strong>
             <br>

             - This technique uses compression fillers or binders that are inert and can be added into the formulation mix so a final drug product (i.e. tablets) will exhibit satisfactory characteristics of hardness, disintegration, and dissolution.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>Film coating</strong>
            <br>

            A very popular technique, owing to a number of coated products in the market. Film coating involves the deposition, usually by a  spraying method, of a thin polymer film to surround the tablet, capsule or multiparticulate core.</li>

            <li><strong>Sugar coating</strong>
            <br>

            Since the late 19th century, this traditional process has been used in the pharmaceutical industry, and it closely resembles the process for coating sweets. This unit operation involves the continuous application of sucrose-based coating onto tablet cores via coating equipment. In this process, water evaporates from the syrup to leave a thick sugar layer around each tablet. Mostly, sugar coats are highly coloured and shiny.</li>

            <li><strong>Compression coating</strong>
            <br>

            In the preparation of modified release products, use and popularity of this process has greatly increased. It is essentially a dry process which involves the compression of granules around a preformed tablet core using specially designed tableting equipment.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>Esco Pharma’s experienced team of designers and engineers can help in designing a completely integrated manufacturing equipment: from the granulation, drying, blending, and even coating process of pharmaceutical manufacturing. All of this to ensure the protection of operators, product, and the environment from possible cross-contamination or unwanted occupational exposure.</p>

                    <p>According to the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), compounded sterile preparation (CSP) is a preparation intended to be sterile that is created by combining, admixing, diluting, pooling, reconstituting, repackaging, or otherwise altering a drug product or bulk drug substance. Sterility is characterized by the absence of any viable microorganisms. </p>

                    <p>CSPs that must be sterile are, but not limited to, the following: </p>


                    <ul>
                        <li>Injections, including infusions </li>
                        <li>Irrigations for internal body cavities <small><em>(i.e., any space that does not normally communicate with the environment outside of the body such as the bladder cavity or peritoneal cavity). [NOTE—Irrigations for the mouth, rectal cavity, and sinus cavity are not required to be sterile.]</em></small> </li>
                        <li>Ophthalmic dosage forms </li>
                        <li>Preparations for pulmonary inhalation. <small><em>[NOTE—Nasal dosage forms intended for local application are not required to be sterile.]</em></small> </li>
                        <li>Baths and soaks for live organs and tissues </li>
                        <li>Implants</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As seen on the table below, CSPs are distinguished into 2 categories based on the conditions under which they are made, their probability for microbial growth, and the time period allotted in which they must be used. </p>

                    <br>
                    <img src="/images/upload/beyond-use-dating-of-category-1-cs-ps-and-category-2-cs-ps-min.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Table 1. Beyond-use dating of category 1 CSPs and category 2 CSPs"
                    <p><strong>Table 1.</strong> <em>Beyond-use dating of category 1 CSPs and category 2 CSPs</em> </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>CSPs are compounded with the use of either sterile or non-sterile starting ingredients. When using sterile ingredient as the start-up component, its sterility must be maintained throughout the entire compounding process to achieve a CSP. While, when a non-sterile ingredient is used, it must first undergo sterilization, either by terminal sterilization in the final sealed container or through sterilizing filtration.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The quality of the components and the effectiveness of the sterilization step are critical to achieving a sterile preparation. Furthermore, aseptic technique must be utilized when preparing any sterile medication. Strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) must also be placed to minimize the potential for cross-contamination.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Sterile compounding facilities must be designed, outfitted, and maintained properly to minimize risk of contamination of CSPs. The design of the facility should take into account factors such as the number of operations being performed, the equipment (e.g., PECs, carts, computers), the personnel in the compounding area (and in adjacent areas), and the complexity of the compounding procedures; which are all considered as critical factors in maintaining control of environmental conditions in the facility. The required air quality within the facility must be achieved and maintained through primary engineering controls (PECs) and secondary engineering controls (SECs). </p>

                    <img src="/images/upload/iso-classification-of-particulate-matter-in-room-air-min.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="ISO Classification of Particulate Matter in Room Air"
                    <p><small>* Limits for number of particles ≥0.5 μm measured under dynamic operating conditions.</small></p>
                    <p><strong>Table 2.</strong><em> ISO Classification of Particulate Matter in Room Air. From USP 42—NF 37: USP General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compounding – Sterile Preparations (pg. 9), by United States Pharmacopeia, 2019, United States Pharmacopeial Convention. </em> </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Facilities used for compounding CSPs must be designed so that air quality improves with movement through separate operational areas, toward the PEC cleanroom. Classified areas where the air quality is controlled include ante-rooms, buffer rooms, and PEC work zone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Primary engineering control (PEC) is defined as a device or zone that provides an ISO Class 5 air quality environment for sterile compounding. Category 1 and Category 2 CSPs must be prepared in a PEC that is certified to meet the ISO Class 5 or better conditions during dynamic operating conditions. PEC must be equipped with HEPA filters and a unidirectional airflow with a velocity sufficient to sweep particles from critical sites; this design prevents cross-contamination. HEPA-filtered air must be supplied by the PEC, and its air velocity must be sufficient to sweep away particles from critical sites and maintain a unidirectional airflow during operations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Collectively, ante-rooms and buffer rooms are called secondary engineering controls. The secondary engineering control room (SEC) is defined as an area where the PEC is placed (e.g., a cleanroom suite or a segregated compounding area). It incorporates specific design and operational parameters required to minimize contamination risk within the compounding area.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ante-rooms which provide access to positive pressure buffer rooms must at least meet the ISO Class 8 classification (see table 1 above); while, ante-rooms providing access to negative pressure buffer rooms must at least meet the ISO Class 7 classification. Typically, activities that potentially generate relatively higher levels of particulates are performed here (e.g., personnel hand hygiene, garbing procedures, and staging of components). The ante-room also serves as a transition area to ensure that proper air classification and pressure relationships are maintained between classified and unclassified areas in a facility.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the other hand, buffer rooms must at least meet an ISO Class 7 air quality. Activities in this room must be controlled to prevent cross-contamination risks during the actual aseptic processing taking place in the PEC.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During occasions where only Category 1 CSPs will be compounded, the PEC may be placed in an unclassified area, without an ante-room or buffer room. This type of design is called a segregated compounding area (SCA). The impact of activities (e.g., patient care activities) that will be conducted around or adjacent to the SCA must be considered carefully, and a visible perimeter must be placed to establish the boundaries of the SCA.

                <br>
                The equipment and supplies used for compounding a CNSP must be suitable for the specific compounding process.

Equipment surfaces that come in contact with components must not be reactive, additive, or sorptive, and must not alter the quality of the CNSPs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Equipment and devices used in the compounding or testing of compounded preparations must be inspected prior to its use and, if appropriate, be verified for accuracy. After compounding, the equipment must be cleaned to prevent cross-contamination of the next preparation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Weighing, measuring, or otherwise manipulating components that could generate airborne chemical particles [e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), excipients, and conventionally manufactured products] must be assessed to determine the type of equipment suitable to handle each; like a closed system processing device to reduce the potential exposure to personnel or contamination of the facility or CNSPs. Examples of closed system processing devices include containment ventilated enclosures (CVEs), biological safety cabinets (BSCs), or single-use containment glove bags.

                When dealing with nonsterile hazardous compounding, C-PEC used must be externally vented (preferred) or have redundant-HEPA filters in series [e.g., Class I Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC), Contaminated Ventilated Enclosure (CVE) or compounding aseptic containment isolator (CACI)].
                <br>
                <br>
                Since HD contamination is difficult to clean, surfaces of ceilings, walls, floors, fixtures, shelving, counters, and cabinets in the nonsterile compounding area must be smooth, impervious, free from cracks and crevices, and non-shedding.
                <br>
                <br>
                A BSC o CACI being used for HDs compounding must not be used when preparing non-HDs unless the non-HD preparation is placed into a protective outer wrapper during removal from the C-PEC and is labeled to require PPE handling precautions.
                <br>
                <br>
                For occasional non-sterile HD compounding, a C-PEC being used for sterile compounding (e.g., Class II BSC or CACI) may be used but must be decontaminated, cleaned and disinfected before resuming to any sterile compounding within the same C-PEC. A C-PEC is not required in cases where manipulation is limited to handling of final dosage forms (e.g., counting or repackaging of tablets and capsules) that do not generate particles, aerosols or gasses.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sterile hazardous compounding</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                During sterile hazardous compounding, operations must be performed in a C-PEC that is externally vented, and capable of providing an ISO Class 5 or better air quality (e.g., Class II or III Biosafety Cabinets or CACI). The C-PEC must be located in a C-SEC, which may either be an ISO Class 7 buffer room with an ISO Class 7 ante-room (preferred) or an unclassified containment segregated compounding area (C-SCA); this may affect the beyond-use date (BUD) of the compounded sterile HD preparation.
                <br>
                <br>
                When both non-sterile and sterile HDs are being compounded within an entity, the respective C-PECs must be placed in separate rooms; unless the C-PECs being used for non-sterile compounding are sufficiently effective that the room can continuously maintain ISO 7 classification throughout the non-sterile compounding activity.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the C-PECs used for sterile and non-sterile compounding are placed in the same room, they must be placed at least 1 meter apart from each other, and particle-generating activity must not be performed while sterile compounding is in process.
                <br>
                <br>
                Esco offers a wide range of products that are fit for handling and compounding of both sterile and nonsterile hazardous drugs. Examples of these include Isolators, Cytotoxic Safety Cabinet, and Ventilated Balance Enclosures.

                <p>Upstream process is the first step of bioprocess from early cell isolation and cultivation, to cell banking and culture development of the cells until final harvest where the desired quantity is reached. Since this is the early stage of bioprocessing, the quality of the product is of critical importance. Sustainability of this procedure must also be considered. Thus, compliance to cGMP standards is required. One of the measurable requirement is to warrant that from this stage to the filling and packaging must ensure sterility of the process. These parameters will include the use of equipment like bioreactors and cell therapy aseptic isolators, presence of a clean room, and only certified biotechnologist and technicians will be allowed to handle the delicate living organisms. </p>

                <p>Cell isolation is one of the most basic practices in cell culture studies and there are various techniques to do this. The importance of these two processes lie in the goal of understanding certain cell mechanisms in order to formulate new biological drugs and combat specific disease types. To do this, a detailed biochemical analysis is required. Most procedures require a large number of cells that must be physically disrupted so their components can be further isolated and proliferated in pure culture for further analysis.
                <br><br>
                If the target cell is part of a tissue, it must first be dissociated and separated in various types. Disrupting the extracellular matrix holding the cells together is the first step to isolate specific cells from a tissue sample; and as studies suggest, the best source of viable dissociated cells are those from fetal or neonatal tissues.
                <br><br>
                The process of disrupting the matrix involves treating the tissue sample with proteolytic enzymes and chelating agents: the former will digest the proteins in the extracellular matrix, while the latter will be binding or chelating the calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) in the matrix to break cell-cell adhesion. Afterwards, proceed with gentle agitation to attain available single living cells. However, the sample achieved from this process is composed of several types of cells, so the next part involves the isolating the different cell types from the suspension.
                <br><br>
                Isolating cells of different types from a suspension involves taking advantage of their variation in physiology. This is better exploited by centrifugation and the capacity of other cells to strongly adhere to glass or plastic and, a much refined technique, to a specific antibody that can only bind to one cell type.
                <br><br>
                However, an even more sophisticated method for cell separation is through the use of an antibody combined to a fluorescent dye. This combination is used to label specific cells so they can be easily separated by non-labelled ones via an electronic fluorescence-activated cell sorter. This machine can easily sort out 1 fluorescent cell from a pool of 1000 unlabelled once and can sort cells a thousandth per second! It does this by allowing individual cells to travel in a single file through a laser beam where the fluorescence of each cell is measured rapidly.
                <br><br>
                Another form of cell isolation is the laser capture microdissection (LCM) which allows isolation of pure cells from a heterogenous mix or from live cells and even cytological preparations. DNA, RNA, and protein biomolecules extracted by this process can be used for downstream applications such as polymerase chain reaction expression studies, and microarray and proteomic analysis.
                <br><br>
                As mentioned earlier, most procedures require a large number of cells that must be physically disrupted so their components can be further isolated and proliferated in pure culture for further analysis.
                <br><br>
                Once specific cells have been isolated from the source, they can then be cultured to allow a much detailed biochemical analysis as well as other formulation studies to be done. More applications of cell culture are for the fields of: monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, enzymes, hormones, interleukins, and certain growth factors.
                <br><br>
                Cell culture basically refers to growing isolated cells in an artificial environment which mimics the conditions of their natural one ~ complete with nutrients as well as certain temperature settings.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Different Types of Cell Cultures:</strong>
                    <ol>
                    <li><strong>Primary Culture</strong>: This is a preparation of cells directly from a parent plant or animal tissue via mechanical or enzymatic measures. Cell proliferation is then maintained through a suitable media in a glass or plastic container whose conditions mimic the original environment. This process can be done without the need to separate different cell types as discussed previously.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cells in a primary culture all have the same karyotype similar to their tissue of origin. Karyotype refers to the same number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a (eukaryotic) cell.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It must be noted that primary cultured cells will have a limited lifespan because of the substrate and nutrient exhaustion which can cause toxin build up and dampen further cell growth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are two different types of primary cell culture based on the kind of cells used:

                        <li><strong>Secondary Culture:</strong> During this process, the cells from the primary culture are transferred to a new vessel equipped with fresh media to facilitate continuous cell proliferation. This process involves disassociating the adhered cells in adherent primary cultures. The importance of this secondary culture is that normally, the amount of cells derived from primary cell culture is insufficient for detailed researches, therefore, with secondary culture, cell population is increased along with their lifespan.
                        <br><br>
                        This process is applicable for generating replicated cultures for characterization, preservation, and further experimentation. </li>

                Cell proliferation refers to the increase in number of cells as a direct result of normal cell growth and division. During the process of vaccine/biological drug formulations, specific cells are targeted and isolated for their benefits to boost patient’s health. Once the target cell has been isolated, it is now time to grow them artificially in the laboratory in order to create biological drugs.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Regulating Cell Proliferation</strong>
                <br><br>
                Cell proliferation is regulated by the presence of several factors such as nutrient levels, temperature, pH, and oxygen, among others, in the internal environment. Cells also use special proteins and specific signalling systems to ensure its proper cycle progression.
                <br><br>
                Before a cell in the resting phase [Gap 0 (G0)] can enter the cell cycle process (G1), it must first be stimulated by a specific protein commonly referred to as the growth factor. Such proteins responsible for activating G0 cells are categorized into four major groups: growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal transducers, and nuclear regulatory proteins. Cell growth is activated via direct stimulation of the cell’s nucleus. To do this, a growth factor must bind to its receptor located on the cell membrane, which will then be temporarily activated. Afterwards, a signal will be transmitted from the cell surface receptor towards the nucleus; therefore, triggering gene transcription involved in cell proliferation.
                <br><br>
                Normally, cell proliferation is composed of four major stages:
                    <br>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
                    <li>Interphase: Gap 1 (G1) phase
                    <br>
                    - This is the phase where the cell increases in size and is preparing to divide.</li>

                    <li>Interphase: Synthesis (S) phase
                    <br>
                    - The phase where cellular DNA is copied.</li>

                    <li> Interphase: Gap 2 (G2) phase
                    <br>
                    - Copies of cellular DNA will then be organized and condensed; cell prepares to divide.</li>

                    <li>Mitosis (M) phase
                    <br>
                    - Cell division process wherein two copies of the genetic material is partitioned into two daughter cells.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                As mentioned earlier, cells also use a signalling system to guarantee proper cell proliferation.
                <ul>
                <li>End of G1 and beginning of G2 checkpoint: helps assess any possible damage in the DNA before and after synthesis.</li>

                <li>Mitosis checkpoint: ensures that all the spindle fibers are properly arranged (metaphase) prior to chromosomal separation (anaphase).</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Normally, any abnormalities detected during such events will force apoptosis or programmed cell death. But in the presence of defective proteins, no apoptosis is triggered, rather, malignant transformation can occur which can later on lead to cancer.
                <br><br>
                In the field of biopharmaceuticals, one way to ensure a reproducible and standardized method of cell proliferation is through the use of bioreactors. Such equipment systems are indispensable tools for cell-based therapies as they maintain a well-controlled microenvironment wherein cells can easily grow.
                <br><br>
                Bioreactors have been extensively used for the expansion of red blood cells, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and even mesenchymal stem cells.
                <br><br>
                There are many different types of bioreactors available in the market today for adherent culture. Choosing the right bioreactor system for cells is crucial for cell culture success. The choice of the bioreactor system to use highly depends on the type of cells to be produced, the desired product, the process of cell culture, and the product density.
                <br><br>
                As part of Esco Healthcare’s division, Esco VacciXcell offers different types of bioreactors for different types of adherent cells.

                <p>Cell banking refers to the collection, processing, and storage of specific cell lines, especially stem cells, with the capacity to provide life-saving biopharmaceutical products. Cell banking offers a reproducible way to manufacture high-quality, safe, and efficient biological products that have undergone proper characterization. Processes involved in cell banking are safe, non-invasive and risk free.
                <br><br>
                Specific cell lines can be stored in cell banks via cryopreservation process which can last for over 25 years. Cryopreservation utilizes very low temperatures proven to reduce biological and chemical reaction rates in order to preserve cells, organelles, tissues, and/or any other biologicals. However, this process risks of fatally injuring the cells due to the formation of ice crystals and even osmotic changes, leading to cellular mechanical constraints. To address such issue, a cryoprotective agent (CPA) is used which affects ice crystal growth, nucleation, and even the rate of water transport.
                <br><br>
                Cryopreservation places biological samples in a state of suspended animation to preserve the fine structure of cells within any time span, and such cryopreserved cells, or even tissues, possess certain advantages for researches and even future clinical studies.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, this constant availability of cryopreserved cells and tissues allow for an exhaustive quality testing to determine transplantation suitability without the need of obtaining fresh samples.

                <p><ul>
                <li> <strong>Slow Freezing:</strong> This process allows the substitution of cytoplastic water with CPAs in order to reduce cell damage and to adjust cooling rate relevant to the cell membrane’s permeability. Theoretically, slow cooling can cause cells to rapidly leak intracellular fluids so it can eliminate super-cooling and ice formation; and since each cell have different permeability capabilities, optimal cooling rate is dependent on cell type
                <br><br>
                Protocols for slow freezing involve an estimated cooling rate of 1°C/min with  < 1.0M CPA with a high-cost controlled rate freezer or a benchtop portable freezing container.

                <br><br>

                Advantages:
                <ul>

                <li>Low risk of contamination</li>

                <li>No need for manipulation skills</li>
                </ul>

                Disadvantage/s:

                <ul>

                <li>High risk of cellular injury due to extracellular ice formation.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                <strong>Vitrification:</strong> This is also known as <em>‘ice-free’</em> cryopreservation utilizing high concentrations of CPAs in order to completely prevent ice formation. CPAs used in this process are at concentrations of 4 to 8 M. However, since each cell varies in their sensitivity or toxicity response to such high concentrations of CPA, there must be different protocols optimized for each.
                <br><br>
                Vitrification is dependent on three (3) factors:

                <ul>

                    <li>Sample viscosity</li>

                    <li>Cooling and warming rates</li>

                    <li>Sample volumes</li>
                </ul>

                Methods of Vitrification:

                    <ul>

                    <li>Equilibrium: This process requires the formulation of multimolar mixtures of cryoprotective agents (CPAs) and their injection into the cell suspensions.</li>

                    <li>Nonequilibrium: Vitrification using this method makes use of either a carrier-based (quartz microcapillaries and cryoloops, among others) or carrier-free system in an extremely high freezing rate condition with lower CPA mixture concentration.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
                Cell banking protocols must be properly optimized for each cell type in order to develop and maintain cell viability, recovery, potency, and overall, to guarantee final biopharmaceutical product safety.<p>

                As part of the biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry, it is important to ensure the timely availability and reproducibility of all raw materials and key ingredients. The process of fermentation is critical in the said industry as it promotes the formation of biopharmaceuticals, food/feed supplements, biofuels, and even chemical building blocks.
                <br><br>
                Since it is a critical process, bioprocess scientists and engineers must optimize a reproducible and cost-effective way to sustain it. To do so the following factors must be considered:
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Costs for media and supplements</li>

                <li>Process runtime</li>

                <li>Bacterial growth and viability</li>

                <li>Product titer and yield</li>

                <li>Product quality</li>

                <li>Culture medium concentrations of nutrients and by-products</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Process development is also the same time that bioprocess engineers will determine the best fermentation approach for the specific cells or samples they would be using.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Fermentation Methods</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Batch Fermentation: This approach uses a fixed volume of medium inside the fermentor wherein the microorganisms will be inoculated. The culture medium needs to be changed periodically to prevent the saturation of the medium with the cells and their by-products.

                <br>
                <br>

                There are different phases of growth that the microorganisms will be subjected to: the <em>initial lag, the exponential growth, the stationary growth, and the death phase.</em>

                <br>
                <br>

                <em>Initial lag phase</em> refers to the period wherein the cells are accustoming to the new environment presented by the fermentor and the culture media; therefore, growth here is slow. Although, once the cells fully adapt to the conditions of the media they will now be entering the <em>exponential phase or log phase</em> wherein cell division occurs. Predictably, this phase is marked with a doubling of cell population. As long as the environmental conditions of the cells are optimal, rapid cell growth will be seen and will be marked with a steep slope on the growth curve.


                <br>
                <br>
                However, once the increased cell population uses up the essential nutrients present in the culture media, they will now be entering the <em>stationary growth phase.</em> By this time, the number of new cells produced is equal to the number of cells dying off, causing a flattening on the growth curve. Notably, new cells produced in this phase try to adapt to the starvation conditions, thus, they are smaller in size, their plasma membrane less fluid and less permeable, and their nucleoid condenses with their DNA becoming bound with DNA-binding proteins from starved cells (DPS). Moreover, cells produced in the stationary phase are prone to yield <u>secondary metabolites</u> which can be antibiotics. Any other cells capable of the sporulation process will be activated at this point in time.

                <br>
                <br>

                The last phase is the <em>death or decline phase</em> wherein the number of viable cells decrease in an exponential way. By this time the culture conditions may have already deteriorated to the point of injuring or damaging the cells in an irreparable way. Notably, studies suggest that 100% cell death is highly unlikely as cells mutate and adapt even in harsh conditions. Thus, a tailing effect is observed wherein a small cell population cannot be killed off and are getting their nutrients from the lysis of dead cells in the same culture.

                <br>
                <br>

                Studies show of a condition called <u>viable but nonculturable (VBNC)</u> which suggests that dead cells can be revived. This research may be of prime importance to pathogens which are capable of entering a state of low metabolism and no cell division in harsh conditions, but resume such activities with better culture conditions.

                <strong>Advantages of Batch Processing:</strong>
                <br>

                <ul>
                <li>Ease of operation</li>

                <li>Low contamination risk</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Disadvantages of Batch Processing:</strong>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Low cell densities</li>

                <li>Long downtime between batches caused by cleaning, vessel setup, and sterilization</li>
                </ul>

                For initial studies and establishment of experimental design, batch fermentation offers a convenient method to optimize culture conditions.
                </li>
                 <br>

                <li>Fed-batch Fermentation: This is a widely used process in the bioprocess industry and is a modified version of the batch fermentation method. In fed-batch fermentation the microorganisms are inoculated and grown while nutrients are added in increments into the fermenter. This process lasts throughout the entire duration of the fermentation to feed the microorganisms. Designing the timeframe for feeding should not allow an excessive saturation of the substrate in order to properly support inoculate growth; especially since the period for feeding is usually marked by a substrate limitation in the broth. At the end of each run, the culture suspension is removed.

                <br>
                <br>

                Fed-batch fermentation process is useful for bioprocesses requiring high product yield.

                <br>
                <br>

                <strong>Advantages of Fed-batch Fermentation:</strong>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Essential for bioprocesses wherein substrate inhibition is required.</li>

                <li>Fed-batch can help control the rate at which the substrate is fed so maximum yield of the desired product is attained.</li>

                <li>Efficient way of accumulating non-growth associated products (e.g. antibiotics)</li>

                <li>Overcoming phenomenon of catabolite repression</li>

                <li>Possible to use organic solvents as nutrient-source</li>

                <li>Possible to control the reaction rate and metabolic reaction via manipulation of the feeding of the limiting substrate.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                </li>

                <li>
                Continuous Fermentation: This process provides fresh medium and harvests cultured cells while removing used medium all at the same time. The constant removal of toxic wastes and used up medium allows the culture volume to stay constant; unlike with fed-batch fermentation, the maximum volume of the vessel does not influence the amount of fresh medium that can be added into the culture throughout the whole process.

                <br>
                <br>
                Continuous fermentation is commonly used in an industrial scale.
                <br>
                <br>

                <strong>Advantages of Continuous Fermentation:</strong>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Simplifies culture scale-up</li>

                <li>Steady state can be achieved wherein rate of cellular growth and environmental conditions remain constant.</li>

                <li>Longer lifespan for cultured samples</li>

                <li>Reduces process downtime</li>

                <li>Cost-effective</li>
                </ul>

              Culturing cells and allowing them to perforate in a laboratory setting to produce advantageous active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), is becoming one of the fastest-growing areas in the field of biotechnology. Much of this success is owed to the fast-paced modernization of technologies for cell culture such as: fermentation, harvesting, and purification.
              <br><br>
              Cell harvesting is done by fully separating the cell culture from the culture media. Main techniques utilized for this process are centrifugation and filtration, with the former being used commonly for scale ups.
              <br><br>
              Through modernized technology under Esco <strong><a href="https://escovaccixcell.com/">VacciXcell</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.escoaster.com/">Esco Aster</a></strong>, Esco can cater to various biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies with an automated cell harvesting process, from start-up to large-scale.
              <br><br>
              Automated harvesting of cells eliminates laborious steps when manually harvesting cells from a system. Different Tide Motion bioreactors are each equipped with its own harvesting system. The harvesting process uses the same conventional method of harvesting adherent cells.

              <p>Filtration is a crucial step in the downstream processing of all types of cell harvesting process since it is also integral to the capture of unwanted impurities, intermediate purification of the sample, and polishing stages. Moreover, filtration is utilized for the preparation of purified water and other liquids for buffering and sanitizing purposes.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Different types of filtration process:</strong>
              <br>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Microfiltration</strong> can be used at the start of the downstream process to clarify the feed beyond what was accomplished in the upstream harvest and centrifugation/clarification.</li>



              <li><strong>Ultrafiltration</strong> is used between chromatography steps to concentrate the product and change the buffer conditions to prepare it for subsequent chromatography steps.</li>



              <li><strong>Sterilizing grade direct flow filtration</strong> involves the use of nanofiltration cartridges to eliminate microbial organisms and insoluble proteins, to remove adventitious and endogenous viruses, and to serve as a sterile filtration process to the product in preparation for final formulation.</li>
              </ul>

              Flow-through devices, assembled with the above membrane media, are formatted to affect two general flow types:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
              <li><strong>Direct Flow Filtration</strong> devices allow the process fluid to cross the membrane in essentially a perpendicular flow direction; this provides little or no prevention of particulate build-up or the concentration of other elements that do not fit through the pore structure.
              <br>
              <br>

              A flat membrane disk is the simplest arrangement of the filter. However, as membrane surface area requirements increase, a pleated sheet either with or without a secondary supporting layer is formed. The combined filtration layer is then wrapped around a perforated collecting core. An advanced version of this type fits an even greater membrane area into the same cartridge volume by folding the pleats over, allowing a greater length of membrane along each fold.

              <br>
              <br>

              In the typical pleated membrane DFF cartridge, flow is directed from the inlet (through the media in a perpendicular or direct path across the membrane) to the outer surface of the media. The flow the collects in the core and exits the holder to the device’s downstream port.</li>
              <br>


              <li><strong>Tangential Flow Filtration</strong> devices orient the membrane so that process flow sweeps across the active filtration surface, which minimizes pore plugging and surface fouling by concentrated reject elements of the feed.



              TFF is rapid and efficient method for separating and purifying process flow. It can be used to recover and purify solutions from small volumes (10 mL) up to thousands of liters. With TFF the feed flows tangentially over the surface of the membrane, where a portion flows through the membrane as permeate.</li>

              <p>
              Centrifugation is one of the most frequently used methods to efficiently separate molecules with different densities through the use of centrifugal force. This process utilizes a high speed rotor that will outwardly move the solid particles from the axis of rotation at a selected speed or revolution per minute (RPM).
              <br><br>
              This method uses the principle of sedimentation where the centripetal acceleration causes much denser substances to move outward while the less dense materials are displaced towards the center.
              <br><br>
              This process is used in molecular biology for the:
                <br>
              <ul><li>Collection of cells</li>

              <li>Precipitation of DNA</li>

              <li>Purification of virus particles</li>

              <li>Differentiation of molecular conformation</li>
              </ul>
              <br>

              <strong>Types of Centrifugation Methods</strong>
              <br>
              <br>

              <ul>
              <li>Differential Pelleting: This is the simplest centrifugation type employed wherein particles in a suspension will sediment at different rates based on their different densities. This method is commonly used for cellular harvesting or when producing crude subcellular fractions from tissue homogenate. The downside of this method lies with the heterogeneity of biological particles which can cause contamination and poor recoveries. But this can be further addressed through resuspension and repeating of the centrifugation steps.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Density Gradient Centrifugation: This method is mainly used for the separation of particles form living cells. But in theory, it can be applied in particle separation of materials with less than 20µm diameter.

              Density Gradient Centrifugation is a procedure for separating particles in which the sample is placed on a preformed gradient like sucrose or caesium chloride.
              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">

              <li>Rate-Zonal Centrifugation: In this type of method, the cross-contamination risk seen in the former method can be avoided through layering the sample as a narrow zone on top of a density gradient. With this, the faster sedimenting particles will not be contaminated by the much slower ones. However, the disadvantage with this technique is the limitation on sample volume that can be accommodated on the density gradient.
              <br><br>
              Rate-zonal centrifugation method uses the size and mass of the particles in order to sediment, not density. With the movement of particles down through the density medium, zones will form with similar sized particles. If centrifuged long enough, the particles will form a pellet based on the fact that the particles density is greater than that of the gradient.</li>
              <br>

              <li>Isopycnic Centrifugation: This method is also known as buoyant or equilibrium separation where particles are separated based solely on their density. The sizes of particles only affect the rate at which they move until their density is the same as the surrounding gradient medium. IT must be noted that the density of the gradient medium must be greater than that of the particles to be separated.</li>
              </ol>
              </li>
             </ul>

            <br>
            <strong>Types of centrifuge</strong>
            <br><br>
            <ol>
            <li>Low-Speed Centrifuge: This type normally runs with a maximum speed of 4000-5000 rpm and is used in most laboratories for routine sedimentation of heavy particles. This centrifuge does not have temperature control and uses two types of rotors:
            <br><br>
             - Fixed angle: this rotor does not use any moving parts, thus offering the following advantages:
             <br>
             <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
             <li>Lower metal stress (longer lifetime)</li>

             <li>Higher maximum g-force</li>

             <li>Faster centrifugation times</li>
            </ol>

             <br>
             However, this rotor is not flexible; the pellet position strongly depends on the angle of the tube which is located from the side of the tube when spinning. The larger angle the tubes have, the tighter the pellets are.
             <br><br>
             - Swinging bucket: This rotor is highly flexible and can be used with different tube formats as well as SBS-format plates. This rotor also has a high sample capacity.
             <br><br>
             Unlike the fixed angle, this rotor has a moving swing-bucket which can cause increased metal stress to the rotor and the buckets. Moreover, the swing-bucket rotor has a lower maximum g-force than the former one, thus causing longer centrifugation times.
             </li>
             <br>

             <li>High-Speed Centrifuge: This centrifuge is mostly used in more sophisticated applications where higher speeds and temperature control are both critical. High-speed centrifuge can have a maximum speed of 15,000-20,000 rpm.
             <br><br>
             There are three types of rotors for type of centrifuge:
                <br>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
             <li>Fixed angle</li>

             <li>Swinging bucket</li>

             <li>Vertical rotor: This rotor is commonly used in ultracentrifugation for isopycnic separations or separation of substances based on density differentiation. Specifically, this rotor is for the isolation of plasmid DNA and sedimentation co-efficient calculation.
             <br><br>
             This rotor has a very low K factor and have the shortest path length for the particles to travel to, which causes particle sedimentation across the tube’s diameter. With this, the advantage of vertical rotor as compared to the former two is its faster sedimentation of particles.</li>

             </ol>

             </li>
             <br>
             <li>Ultracentrifugation: This is a specialized technique to spin samples at a remarkably high speed. Current ultracentrifuges can spin up to as much as 150,000 rpm, the downside is that it can cause overheating. To address this issue and avoid sample damage, ultracentrifuges are equipped with vacuum systems that keep a constant temperature in their rotor.
             <br><br>
             The principle of this process is the same as normal centrifugation and abides by the following:
                <br>
                <ul>
             <li>A denser biological structure causes faster sedimentation</li>

             <li>A bigger biological particle moves faster in a centrifugal field</li>

             <li>A denser buffer system causes a slower particle movement</li>

             <li>A greater frictional coefficient causes a slower particle movement</li>

             <li>A greater centrifugal force causes a faster particle sedimentation rate</li>

             <li>The sedimentation rate of a particle will be zero once the density of the particle and its medium are equal</li>
                </ul>
             </li>
             </ol>

              <p>
              Electrophoresis is essential in the field of molecular biology for the separation and analysis of DNA, RNA, or protein molecules based on their size and electrical charge. Samples are loaded into wells at one end of a permeable gel matrix before electrical current is applied; with one end having a positive charge and the other a negative charge. Therefore, biological molecules are separated as each migrate towards its opposite charge: a molecule with negative charge will be pulled towards the positive end, vice-versa. Moreover, separation is achieved since the smaller molecules can move faster and can cover a wider distance through the gel as compared to larger ones.
              <br><br>
                Electrophoresis has gained high importance in the era of genome sequencing with its ability to provide speed and accuracy during nucleic acid analysis. It helps to distinguish DNA fragments of different lengths.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Types of Electrophoresis</strong>
              <br><br>

              With the electrophoresis technique of separation, various gels can be used as the support medium --  either in a slab or tube form. Gel slabs are frequently used as they allow the numerous samples to be ran concurrently. But the main advantage of tube gels is that they give better resolution of the results, as such, they are usually picked for the electrophoresis of proteins.

              <li>DNA Electrophoresis: Agarose gel is most commonly used in this type of electrophoresis. Its large pore structure allows the easy movement of large molecules; however, having said that, it is not suitable for smaller molecules.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE): This type of gel is most suitable for quantitative analysis of samples as it allows a clearer resolution of the results. Polymerized acrylamide (polyacrylamide) forms a mesh-like matrix that allows the separation of proteins based on their size. This process is widely used in the fields of: biochemistry, forensics, genetics, molecular biology and biotechnology.
              <br><br>
              PAGE works similarly to the general principle of electrophoresis which causes the separation of molecules through a gel matrix: smaller ones migrate further due to lesser resistance. However, there are also other attributes that can influence the rate of migration of the molecules such as the structure and charge of the protein.
              <br><br>
              The most commonly used PAGE process for protein separation is the sodium dodecyl sulphate or sodium lauryl sulphate – PAGE (SDS-PAGE) which is purely based on the polypeptide chain length. Normally with general electrophoresis techniques, it is not possible to separate proteins based solely on their chain length because the molecular mobility through the gel will depend on both charge and size/structure. However, if the molecules will attain a uniform charge, then it would be possible.
              <br><br>
              In SDS-PAGE, because of the presence of SDS, along with a reducing agent, the influence of charge is eliminated. This is because the SDS chemical detergent is a strong acting protein-denaturant, and together with a reducing agent, they can cause the samples to attain uniform charge (usually negatively charged) and cleave disulphide bonds to unfold the linear chains. Therefore, when the proteins under SDS-PAGE are loaded onto the gel and placed in an electrical field, they will move towards the oppositely charged field while being separated via molecular sieving effect based solely on chain length. The protein’s size can then be calculated by comparing its migration distance to a known molecular weight ladder; the movement can be visualized via protein-specific.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Two-Dimensional (2D) Electrophoresis: This is a classical method for the separation of proteins based on two properties: charge and size. In the first dimension, proteins are separated by the isoelectric point value which refers to the pH at which a particular molecule does not have an electric charge.  For the second dimension electrophoresis, its basis is the sample’s relative molecular weight.</li>
              </ol>
              For complex protein mixtures, this process is done in combination with two other methods:  isoelectric focusing (IEF) and SDS-PAGE. In the first step, protein is separated into its charges via IEF, afterwards, they are treated with SDS and will result to negatively charged samples. Therefore, the samples focused in the pI will then be separated primarily due to their molecular weights.

              <p>
              In the development phase of all drugs, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) often dictates the type of dosage form that the final marketable product will be. It all comes down to how the API will remain stable in storage and of course, once it enters the body before it reaches its target release site. In order to ensure the stability of the final dosage form, formulation studies must be efficiently done.
             <br><br>
              Achieving a successful formulation study requires a systematic planning and design of the manufacturing process. To obtain such success, the following basic components must be considered:
                <br>
              <ul>
              <li>Physicochemical attributes of the API</li>

              <li>Compatibility of excipients</li>

              <li>Manufacturing procedure</li>
              </ul>

              The major concern of formulation studies is really on the interaction of the API and its excipients as these are hard to predetermine. The output of such studies (physical/chemical/therapeutic interactions) will then help dictate the final recipe for a certain drug dosage form.
              <br><br>
              Moreover, it must also be noted that pharmaceutical formulation studies must be free from any untoward microbial or chemical contamination as these events may change both the physicochemical and therapeutic properties of the formulation. To ensure this, preservatives are added both to prolong shelf life and to maintain sterility for a specific period of time.
              <br><br>
              The formulation process may be divided into:
                <br>
              <ul>
              <li>Pre-formulation</li>

              <li>Formulation:</li>

              <li>Process Development</li>
              </ul>

              Prior to the process development part, formulation studies involve understanding the biological API on the level of is amino acid sequence, biochemical and biophysical characteristics (pH), ionic strength, possible excipients, and even stability-indicating assays to check possible degradation pathways for the biologic under study.
              <br><br>
              Nowadays, the field of biologicals and biopharmaceuticals is growing rapidly so it is important to determine all potential issues in every stage of its development. Along with the rise of such drugs comes also the increase in complexity of formulating longer-acting formulations with larger injection volumes and longer injection durations. One of the major challenges faced by the biopharmaceutical industry is the stabilisation of the drug during processing. Main reason is that these substances are inherently unstable and prone to degradation, hence, a variety of excipients is required to stabilise aseptic/sterile biologicals during manufacturing processes.
              <br><br>
              On this note, formulation studies are critical as this is where the final excipients for drug stability, and of course efficiency, is determined. Finalizing the drug recipe at an early stage will also lessen operational costs as it can prevent drug product recalls and any unwanted adverse drug reactions once the drug is released in the market. Therefore, having the most suitable excipients combined with the selected API will dictate the success of developing a possible novel drug.

              Excipients are a very important factor in formulation studies as they contribute in the development of both small and large molecule drugs. These are pharmacologically inert substances on their own, but offers tons of advatnages once combined with the API.
              <br><br>
              Historically speaking, such excipients were first used as a vehicle for the API or even a flavorant. But now, these substances have their own functional roles, and for large molecule manufacturing (vaccines and proteins), the offer the following advatnages:
              <ul>

              Understanding the mechanism of action on how the excipients stabilise biological products is key to a successful formulation study. The following factors can impact conformational stability:
            <br>
            <ul>
               <li> Electrostatic interactions</li>

               <li>Van der Waals interactions</li>

               <li>Hydrophobicity</li>
             </ul>
                As an example, a biological or large molecule drug in its native conformation (biologically active state) can be stabilised with the use of high concentrations of saccharides (sucrose, trehalose, lactose etch.) or a high concentration of polyhydric alcohols (sorbitol, mannitol etc.), all owing to their preferential exclusion from the surface of said biological.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, another class of excipients known as surfactants or surface active agents, can be added to prevent protein denaturation at interfaces of both air-water and solid-water, thus, enhancing stability via differential binding. In the prevention of both soluble and insoluble protein aggregation, on the other-hand, Polysorbate 20/80, or even Pluronic F68 may be used.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, for liquid formulations of multi-dose biological products, it is important to use antimicrobial preservatives to increase final product stability. Possible cases wherein the biological in an aqueous solution is still unstable, may force the inclusion of lyophilisation or freeze drying in the final manufacturing process; and this will dissuade the use for any preservative excipients even for multi-dose drugs. Such formulation will then be reconstituted via bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI).

              More often than not, adjuvants are used in the formulation of vaccines in order to enhance its therapeutic properties by increasing the stimulation of the body’s immune response.
                <br><br>
                Some vaccines are made from weakened microbes and these naturally contain adjuvants to promote a stronger immune response from the body. However, nowadays most of the developed vaccines constitute only a small component of the microbe/virus/bacteria rather than the whole thing, so adjuvants must be added to help generate a stronger immune response and overall, protect the person form contracting the disease any longer.
                <br><br>
                It must be noted however, that adjuvants may cause unwanted adverse reactions after vaccination such as:
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>Redness</li>

                <li>Swelling</li>

                <li>Pain at the injection site</li>

                <li>Fevers and chills</li>

                <li>Body aches</li>
                </ul>
                In the US, there are several types of adjuvants approved for use such as:

              <p>
              Large molecule drugs in the biopharmaceutical filed such as proteins and vaccines are administered in a parenteral/injectable route to directly reach the body’s systemic circulation. As such, they must be manufactured in a very aseptic/sterile conditions to remove the risk of microbial contamination which can easily degrade the product and cause unwanted adverse effects to the patients.
                <br><br>
                As per Annex 6 of the World Health Organization (WHO) good manufacturing practices for sterile pharmaceutical products:

                <br><br>


                <em>“The production of sterile preparations should be carried out in clean areas, entry to which should be through airlocks for personnel and/or for equipment and materials.


                <br><br>

                Clean areas should be maintained to an appropriate standard of cleanliness and supplied with air that has passed through filters of the required efficiency.”</em>
                <br>
                <br>

                <img src="/images/upload/maximum-allowable-particle-concentration.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="ISO Classification of Particulate Matter in Room Air">
                <p class="text-center"><strong>Table 1.</strong><em> US standards for Air Cleanliness classification follow ISO 14644-1 guidelines.</em></p>

                <br>
                <p>As per the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) current good manufacturing guideline (cGMP), there are two different ways to manufacture sterile products:
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                    <li><strong>Terminal Sterilization</strong>
                    <br>
                    - This involves filling and sealing product containers under high-quality environmental conditions to minimize the microbial and particulate content of the in-process product. This helps ensure that the subsequent sterilization process is successful.
                    <br>
                    In its final container, the product is then subjected to a sterilization process such as heat or irradiation. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Aseptic Processing</strong>
                    <br>
                    - In an aseptic process, the drug product, container, and closure are first subjected to sterilization methods separately, as appropriate, and then brought together. </li>

                    </ol>
                    <br>

                    There is no process to sterilize the product in its final container, so it is critical that containers be filled and sealed in an <strong>extremely</strong> high-quality environment.
                    <br><br>
                    Aseptic processing involves more variables than terminal sterilization. Before aseptic assembly into a final product, the individual parts of the final product are subjected to various sterilization processes. Each of these processes require validation and control to prevent errors that could lead to the distribution of a contaminated product.
                    <br><br>
                    Any manual or mechanical manipulation of the sterilized drug, components, containers, or closures prior to or during aseptic assembly poses the risk of contamination and thus necessitates careful control.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, as per the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) general chapter <797> in the production or preparation of sterile pharmaceuticals, the critical area where direct handling of the substance will be done, must be of an ISO Class 5 environment.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Advancements in Fill-Finish Operations</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Pharmaceutical manufacturing involves complex and state-of-the-art process systems that have individually undergone strict validation tests for the assurance of repeatedly producing high quality products.
                    <br><br>
                    For more than half a century, pharmaceutical companies have been using an established industrial principle commonly known as &lsquo;batch manufacturing&rsquo;, which involves the use of an inconvenient number of individual equipment for each process. In fact, these units are so multifaceted that some of them are housed in an entirely separate Grade A environment; leaving a very large footprint. Running and maintaining these systems are highly expensive and not flexible enough to meet the fluctuating market demands.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, since this type of manufacturing is comprised of numerous discrete steps, the potential for human error is relatively high. To combat such problems agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), have taken advantage of the recent technological advances in the field.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <ul>

                    <li><strong>Continuous Manufacturing</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong><a href="/news/paving-the-way-for-continuous-manufacturing">Continuous manufacturing (CM)</a></strong> refers to the concept of connected production; taking advantage of automation technology to link all operations together. This eliminates the possibility of delays in-between steps and allows the processed materials to move non-stop within the same facility. All the raw materials and other necessary manufacturing components are entered into a fully integrated assembly line; making it fast, flexible, and cost-effective.

                    <br><br>

                    Although moving from traditional to continuous manufacturing is fairly expensive, CM offers a promise of aseptic/sterile facilities with smaller footprint, lesser maintenance cost, and with a higher industrial profit.

                    <br><br>

                    In the manufacture of vaccines or other biopharmaceuticals, the best way to achieve such advanced manufacturing with lesser risk for microbial contamination and other sterility issues, is with the use of filling line systems.

                    <br><br>

                    A filling line is an integral part of manufacturing sterile pharmaceutical products. It ensures that parenteral medications are prepared inside an ISO classified environment for the whole manufacturing cycle, which is achieved through the use of a Restricted Access Barrier System (RABS) or an isolator (See <a href="/news/esco-pharma-ventures-the-art-of-filling-line-systems"><em>Esco Pharma Ventures the Art of Filling Line Systems</em></a>)

                <br>
                Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are the new class of highly potent biopharmaceutical drug with high specificity for cancer therapy. There are three components that make up an ADC: 1) a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 2) a linker, and 3) a biologically active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) with cytotoxic properties.
                <br><br>
                <img class="img-fluid w-100 mb-2" src="/images/upload/macromolecule-effector-payload-min.jpg" alt="Antibody drug conjugate parts">

                <br>
                These novel pharmaceuticals are target-specific since it can deliver highly potent cytotoxic drugs to the tumour site and not harm the healthy cells unlike conventional chemotherapy.
                <br><br>

                ADCs deliver deactivated cytotoxins to specific cancer cells. Once attached to the affected cell, the ADC internalizes into the cell and undergoes the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis wherein the cytotoxin is released, producing a cytotoxic activity. The final process leads to a rapid cancer cell death.
                <br><br>

                The design and synthesis of an effective ADC is challenging, requiring specialized equipment for the concept to be a reality.
                <br><br>

                In order to deliver quality antibody drug conjugates, these undergo a tedious process of manufacturing in very stringent conditions. Under strict containment, the process starts from dispensing and weighing of cytotoxic agents, up to packing-off the finished products.
                <br><br>

                Weighing and preparation of cytotoxins with organic solvents are done in an isolator, since it permits safe handling of cytotoxins in a negative pressure environment. The mixture is then transferred into a conjugation site by a hard-piped transfer line. The isolator must be designed with a Clean-In-Place (CIP) system that permits inactivation of the cytotoxin or other microbes which comes in contact with potent cytotoxins to remove the contamination.
                <br><br>

                In the conjugation site, the linking of the antibody and cytotoxin is performed inside a strict containment facility, in a sealed temperature and pH controlled stainless steel tank, with nitrogen overlay. Special equipment like double mechanical seals, overflow trays, and positive displacement pumps are also needed to strengthen personnel protection. After this process, the ADC contained in the buffer is transferred to the formulation site for bulk formulation.
                <br><br>

                All the wastes from the process are inactivated and incinerated on site, depending on the process requirements. After the cytotoxic agent concentration adjustment and excipient addition in the formulation site, the Bulk Drug Substance (BDS) is stored frozen at around -20 to -60 °C using a controlled freezer and aseptically dispensed into multiple PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol) bottles for bulk storage.

                Clinical ADC manufacturing must be executed in an aseptic biological manufacturing environment which operates under cGMP since the antibody modification and cytotoxin conjugation reaction are usually executed under process conditions which will support growth of environmental microbial contaminates. Batch failures resulting from human error or equipment failure are typically low for biological manufacturing.

                <br>
                In the antibody modification suite the naked antibody raw material which is typically frozen at -20°C is thawed and the storage buffer is exchanged via tangential flow filtration. Buffer exchange is often required to alter the pH, salt concentration and remove excipients used to improve storage stability in the bulk antibody solution which may hinder or alter the performance of the conjugation reaction. These steps include the isolator used for weighing and preparation of the solution containing the cytotoxin (<a href="/products/weighing-and-dispensing-containment-isolator/26">Weighing and Dispensing Containment Isolator</a>, <a href="/products/containment-barrier-isolator-t/31">Containment Barrier Isolator</a>, and <a href="/products/aseptic-containment-isolator/17">Aseptic Containment Isolator</a>) and  the conjugation suite, in which the cytotoxin is combined stoichiometrically with the antibody linker complex. <a href="/solutions/downstream-process">Bulk ultrafiltration or chromatography</a> is then employed to remove process contaminants such as free cytotoxin and organic solvent.

              <strong>Categories of Compounding</strong>
              <br><br>

              As per the United States Pharmacopeia <29>, there are different compounding categories and they are intended to guide compounding operators or technicians when the different forms are prepared. Each of these categories correspond to a separate training required to be undertaken by the operators before they will be allowed to prepare such products.

                Dilution is the process of adding another solvent to a solution in order to decrease its concentration, hence, maintaining the amount of solute to a certain amount while increasing the total volume of the solution.
                <br><br>
                Another way of achieving dilution is by mixing a solution with a higher concentration of solute to that of a solution with lesser solute amount.
                <br><br>

                The process of dilution is very important in laboratory settings as the stock solutions or reagents are usually purchased in highly concentrated forms. Most of the laboratory experiments cannot be done with highly concentrated reagents, so the act of dilution must be done in order to taper the concentration into a lesser known one.
                <br><br>

                In the pharmacy setting, operators are taught certain dilution calculations with the basic formula represented as:
                <br>
                <br>
                </p>
                <div class="px-5" style="max-width:600px; margin:auto;display:block">
                <p class="font-weight-bold text-center">M1 V1 = M2 V2</p>

                <p>
                Wherein:
                <ul>
                <li>M1: refers to the original ‘known’ concentration of the solution;</li>

                <li>V1: refers to the original ‘known’ volume of the solution;</li>

                <li>M2: represents the concentration of the diluted solution; and</li>

                <li>V2: represents the final, usually ‘unknown’, volume of the solution.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Concentration of Solutions</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Solutions are made up of two main components:
                <ul>
                <li>Solute: refers to the dissolved material in the solution.</li>

                <li>Solvent: the liquid component where the solute is dissolved.</li>
                </ul>
                The concentration of the preparation depends on the amount of solute in a given amount of solvent, and in the laboratory setting, the two most common ways to depict concentration is molarity (M) and molality (m).
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Molarity</strong> refers to the molar concentration of a solute per liter of a solution.

                <ul>
                <li>M = moles (n) of solute / L of solution</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Molality</strong> represents the ratio of the moles of a solute to the amount (kg) of a solvent.

                <ul>
                <li>M = moles (n) of solute / kg of solvent</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mole (n)</strong> is defined as 6.02214076 x 1023 of a chemical unit (atoms/molecules/ions, etc.). It must be well noted that the amount of atoms, etc., in a mole is the same for all substances. The concept of moles can also be used to determine the simplest formula of a compound and even to calculate the quantities involved in chemical reactions.

                <ul>
                <li>n = grams of solute / molecular weight (g/n) of the solution</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>

                Levigation is the process of decreasing the particle size of powders via triturating them with a mortar and pestle along with a small amount of liquid wherein the substance is insoluble to. This specific liquid is called a levigating agent and is viscous in nature with a low surface tension to easily wet the solid particles. Such agents also act as a lubricant as they also allow a smoother incorporation of solids in the preparation.

                Radioactive tracers are those substances composed of tightly bonded molecules with a radioactive atom. Such substances or tracers often use molecules that normally interact with a specific protein or sugar in the body so medical practitioners can easily determine the exact source of the disease. Others even employ the use of the patient’s own cells which can be seen in cases of a Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scan wherein healthcare workers radiolabel or add radioactive atoms to a sample of the patient’s red blood cells and then follow its path until they trace the place where it accumulates highly in the body; these areas are called ‘hot spots’.
                <br><br>
                Radiopharmaceuticals are the approved tracers meeting the standards set the by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Nuclear medicine physicians are those who specialize the use of such substances to assess body functions, diagnose, and even treat specific diseases. Moreover, the radiopharmaceutical of choice is the thing that determines if the patient must undergo either a SPECT or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan.

                Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scan utilizes equipment that provides three-dimensional (tomographic) images showing the distribution of the radiopharmceutical or tracer molecules injected in the patient. These photos are generated by a computer from various amounts of projected images recorded during the scan with different body angles. The computer uses a set of cameras mounted on a rotating gantry which in turn, moves the detectors in a tight circle around the pallet where the patient lies on a supine position, motionless.
                <br><br>
                The radiopharmaceuticals used in SPECT scan must emit gamma rays injected to the patient. These rays move at a different wavelength than visible light. Also, the detectors used during SPECT scan can easily detect these gamma rays.
                <br><br>
                There have been a large number of compounds radiolabelled with gamma-emitting substances to allow imaging of different types of cancer.

                <p>

                Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan is another type of powerful imaging technique utilizing radiopharmaceuticals to generate three-dimensional images. It uses quantitative information based on the distribution of positron emitters (PET radiopharmaceuticals) injected or administered reflected by the patient’s body.
                <br><br>
                PET studies produce images representing the distribution or the pattern of distribution as taken up by the body which can vary based on its current physiologic, pharmacologic, and biochemical state. As such, PET scans are able to provide information of the bodily functions of a patient.
                <br><br>

                The difference between the SPECT and PET scan lies on the type of radiopharmaceuticals or radiotracers, used. While SPECT utilizes substances emitting gamma rays, PET uses radiotracers that produces small particles called positrons during their decay.
                <br><br>

                Positrons have the ability to react with the body’s electrons as they are oppositely charged (positron is positively charged while electrons are negative). When these particles combine, they annihilate each other, an act that produces a small amount of energy in the form of photons, and these shoot off in different directions. The PET scanner then measures these photons and utilizes them to create images of the internal organs of the patient.
                <br><br>

                Glucose utilization is dependent on the intensity of cellular and tissue activity and is greatly increased in rapidly dividing cancer cells. One fact is that, the degree of a cancer’s aggressiveness can be measured as it is paralleled by their rate of glucose utilization. For the past decade or so, glucose molecule called F-18 labeled deoxyglucose or FDG, has been shown to be the best tracer to detect cancer and its metastatic spread in a patient.
                <br><br>

                The main purpose of PET scan is to detect and monitor and detect metastases as well as track the progression of cancer in response to treatment.
                <br><br>

                A combination instrument that produces both PET and CT scans of body regions one exam has become the primary tool for cancer staging worldwide.
                <br><br>

                Moreover, recently a PET probe was approved by the USFDA for the accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.

                The manufacturing process of preparing radiopharmaceuticals should meet Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) criteria. The institution must ensure that these substances are of high-quality and will not be contaminated with any long-lived impurities after the period of their decay.
                <br><br>
                It must be noted that the radionuclide composition of some preparations is determined via the chemical and isotopic composition of the target materials. Trial preparations are advisable especially when new batches of target material are used.
                <br><br>
                The general way to manufacture radionuclides to be used for radiopharmaceutical preparations are as follows:

                </p>
                <p>
                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">
                <li><strong>Nuclear fission:</strong> During this process, an atom’s nucleus breaks up into two lighter nuclei. This process is usually observed in nuclides with high atomic numbers: i.e., the fission of Uranium-235 using neutrons in a nuclear reactor.
                <br><br>
                Nuclear fission can either happen spontaneously or with the excitation of the nucleus. The latter method can be achieved by using neutrons, protons, deuterons, or alpha particles; it can even be done via electromagnetic radiation using gamma rays.
                <br><br>
                A large amount of energy is released during the fission process, causing the production of radioactive substances and the emission of several neutrons. Said neutrons can further induce nuclear fission on nearby fissionable nucleuses, thereby, causing a chain reaction. This chain reaction is then responsible for the release of enormous amounts of energy, which if left uncontrolled, can lead to the production of an atomic bomb. In nuclear plants however, such chain reaction is controlled for societal benefits such as in the production of electrical power.
                <br><br>
                In the laboratory setting, nuclear fission can result to radioisotopes that can be used for diagnostic and/or treatment procedures. Such a controlled process must be done inside an equipment designed to handle radioactive substances, and all personnel involved must have had proper training.<br><br></li>



                <li><strong>Charged particle bombardment:</strong> In this process, radionuclides are produced by bombarding target materials with charged particles inside particle accelerators like the cyclotron.<br><br></li>



                <li><strong>Neutron bombardment:</strong> Similar to the above method, radionuclides can be produced by bombarding the target material with neutrons, and this is usually seen in nuclear reactors. Basically, the energy of the incident particle together with the isotopic composition and purity of the target material plays a significant role in triggering the desired nuclear reaction.<br><br></li>



                <li><strong>Radionuclide generator system:</strong> Radionuclides with short half-lives can be produced using a radionuclide generator system. Radionuclide generators, also referred to as ‘cows,’ contain a long-lived radionuclide – or <em>‘parent nuclide’</em>- which will then decay into a short-lived radionuclide of interest known as <em>‘daughter nuclide’</em>. These daughter nuclides obtained from such generators have a significant use in the medical diagnosis (imaging scans), treatment, or any other radionuclide tracer applications.<br><br>
                Two types of parent-daughter generator systems:
                <br><br>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li><strong>Transient Equilibrium Generator</strong> – This generator contains a parent radionuclide with a half-life greater than that of the daughter’s. This is generally seen in generators for 99Mo/<sup>99m</sup>Tc which relies on the availability of the long-lived parent radionuclide decaying further into a daughter substance with shorter half-life but with beneficial physical and decay properties.
                    <br><br>

                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> <em> Events inside a Transient Equilibrium Generator. </em> </p>
                    <br>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Secular Equilibrium Generator</strong> – The concept used here is that even the short-life of the parent radionuclide is longer than the daughter’s. There will not be a noticeable decay in the parent’s half-life even with the production of many daughter radionuclide.
                    <br><br>
                    The rate of daughter radionuclide production is initially greater than its rate of decay, the daughter will further increase until it reaches an equilibrium wherein its rate of production is equivalent to its rate of decay (daughter decays with a half-life similar to the parent’s).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                Guidelines recommend that all materials and excipients (starting materials including precursors for syntheses) for the production of radiopharmaceuticals, are of high quality. Since the amount of the radioactive material is relatively small as compared to its excipients, the latter can have a significant influence on the overall quality of the final preparation. The excipients contained in a radiopharmaceutical preparation must be permitted by general monographs, and they must be used according to the required dosage form.
                <br><br>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Sterilization:</strong> Sterile radiopharmaceuticals for parenteral route should be properly sterilized, and whenever possible, terminal sterilization is recommended. For most preparations though, filtration is the method of choice.

                <br><br>

                Notably, all sterilization methods must be validated prior to use. If there is a small batch size of preparation (one or few samples with very short half-lives), the entire manufacturing process must be validated.<br><br></li>



                <li><strong>Antimicrobial preservatives:</strong> Most radiopharmaceutical injections are released in multidose containers, and as a general practice, these such substances should normally contain an antimicrobial preservative. But this is not always the case for most radiopharmaceuticals; whether or not a preparation contains an antimicrobial preservative, it should be stated on the label accordingly.


                <br><br>
                Radiopharmaceutical injections with shelf-life >1 day inside multidose containers should have a suitable antimicrobial preservative.</li>

                <p>
                There are individual monographs for the identity testing of radionuclides for the purpose of radiopharmaceutical preparations.
                <br>
                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">
                <li><strong>Half-life measurement:</strong> The preparation is recommended to be tested after appropriate dilution as this would avoid necessary losses. The following equipment must be available during this process: ionizing chamber, Geiger-Muller counter, and a scintillation counter (or a semiconductor detector).
                <br><br>
                Sufficient radioactivity during this period is required in order to easily detect several estimates of the material’s half-life, and measurements of such should not deviate by more than 5% from what is stated in the specific monograph.</li>
                </ul>
                Once the exact radiopharmaceutical has been properly prepared and identified, the purity of the radionuclide must then be observed.
                <br><br>
                Two ways to specify radionuclide purity:
                <br><br>

                <ol>
                <li><strong>Expression of a minimum level of purity:</strong> As per individual monographs, the preparation’s gamma-ray spectrum should not vary as much from the standard solution during its entire shelf-life.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Expression of maximum levels of specific impurities:</strong> There are known impurities during the production of the preparation – for example, the presence of thallium-202 (t1/2 = 12.23d) during preparation of thalium-201 (t1/2 = 73.5h).</li>
                </ol>
                For the actual radiochemical itself, purity is therefore assessed via analytical techniques such as liquid, paper, thin-layer chromatographs and even electrophoresis. Radioactivity distribution n the chromatogram must be done after or during separation.
                <br><br>
                The method of choice to measure radiochemical activity depends on the nature of the radiation and the actual separation technique. Normally the amount of radioactive material used in chromatographic support (paper/plate/column) is very small due to the high-sensitivity of detection; caution must be observed during this process, especially with the interpretation of results.
                <br><br>
                Adding to the complexity of the process of measuring radiochemical purity is the presence of carriers (non-reactive compounds), as risks of the latter reacting with certain radiochemical impurities is ever present; this can further lead to impurity underestimation. For situations that a simple chromatograph fails, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is therefore the next choice.  </p>

                For years radiolabelled blood cells played a critical role as diagnostic tracers especially for cardiac blood pool imaging or thrombus detection. Studies suggested that components of thrombotic and fibrinolytic systems are able to carry radiolabels to a specific thrombi. In recent years, new methods have been studied including the improved method of conducting platelet labelling.
                <br><br>
                Key characteristic of a radiotracer used for blood cell labelling is its ability to easily bind to target cells (i.e. thrombi) and of course, its rapid blood disappearance rate. These two ensure provision of a clear patient diagnosis within a few hours.
                <br><br>
                Clinical Indications of Blood Cell Labelling:
                <ul>

                <li>Measurement of total red blood cell (RBC) volume</li>

                <li>Measurement of RBC survival time</li>

                <li>Identification of RBC destruction sites</li>

                <li>Blood pool imaging studies (i.e. gastrointestinal bleeding)</li>

                <li>Selective spleen imaging with damaged RBCs</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <strong><sup>99m</sup>Tc Labelled Red Blood Cells (RBCs)</strong>
                <br><br>

                Using the isotope of technetium-<sup>9</sup>9m (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) to label red blood cells in nuclear cardiology is well established. This isotope is able to efficiently distribute itself inside the body’s intravascular pool and subsequently, able to leave it at a slow rate. This timeframe allows practitioners to collect high resolution images with the use of a gamma scintillation camera. Even information on regional myocardial wall motion and left ventricular ejection fraction can be obtained.
                <br><br>
                If this isotope is used in its pertechnetate form (TcO4-) it can mimic the movement and distribution characteristics of iodine, and as such, concentrates into the thyroid and salivary glands, gastric mucosa, and even the choroid plexus (network of blood vessels in each ventricle of the brain). However, because of this characteristic, this radioisotope is not firmly bound to RBCs and will easily diffuse into the extravascular fluid compartment, and accumulate in aforementioned organs. Thus, it is important that the <sup>99m</sup>Tc is firmly bound to the cells and will persist in vivo during the observation period.
                <br><br>
                <img src="/images/upload/studies-established-a-99-m-tc-labelling-method.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-2" alt="Events inside a Transient Equilibrium Generator">
                <p>Studies established a <sup>99m</sup>Tc labelling method with 50 to 60% efficiency reports through the use of stannous chloride as a reducing. The method is as follows: </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-center"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> <em> Method of labelling <sup>99m</sup>Tc with SnCl2 </em> </p>
                <br><br>

                Actual red blood cell labeling with <sup>99m</sup>Tc occurs whenever <sup>99m</sup>Tc pertechnetate is brought into contact with RBCs previously treated with stannous ions. This can be accomplished by either the in vivo or in vitro addition of Tc-<sup>99m</sup> pertechnetate to RBCs that have been pre-treated with stannous ions.
                <br><br>
                It must be noted tohough that even if it is technetium in the +7 (pertechnetate) oxidation state that crosses the intact erythrocyte membrane, only technetium reduced to a lower oxidation state will firmly bind to hemoglobin. This is where the importance of stannous chloride comes in as normally, stannous ions are often employed for the reduction of technetium.
                <br><br>
                Stannous ions hydrolyses and precipitates at physiologic pH, so in vivo and modified in vivo methods are done via direct intravenous administration.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, in order to reduce the concentration of extracellular stannous ions, biological clearance must be observed. There should be a 20 to 30-minute allowance in between the injection of the stannous solution and the administration of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc. Previous practice suggests the use of centrifugation in order to remove the extracellular stannous ions.

                <br><br>
                <strong>Labelling Methods with <sup>99m</sup>Tc RBC:</strong>
                <br><br>
                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">
                <li><strong><em>In Vitro Kits</em></strong> – simplified the labelling process of <sup>99m</sup>Tc radioisotopes with stannous citrate and glucoheptonate by eliminating the multiple washing steps previously employed, along with removing the need to extemporaneously and aseptically compound said stannous substances (for intravenous (IV) injection).
                <br><br>
                A major advantage brought by said kits is the ability to prepare reagents in advance and store them.<br><br></li>

                <li><strong><em>In Vivo Method:</em></strong> labelling is accomplished with two subsequent IV injections – first with the non-radioactive stannous solution and followed by the <sup>99m</sup>Tc pertechnetate.<br><br></li>

                <li><strong><em>Modified In-Vivo Method: </em></strong> generally evolved from the above technique with a measurable rate of incorporation into RBCs. During labelling and after a sufficient period, pretinned RBCs and <sup>99m</sup>Tc pertechnetate are isolated from body compartments. The blood labelled cells will then have 90% of the total technetium isotope tightly bound to the RBCs, resulting to an increased intravascular retention and therefore, an improved image quality.</li>

                Nanofabrication refers to the methods of preparing nanotechnology, and there are two main methods of doing so.<br>
                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">
                <li>
                <strong>Top-Down Strategy:</strong> Basically refers to the need to miniaturize current technologies.
                <br><br>
                It starts from a bulk material with the capacity to incorporate nanoscale information. In the field of biomedical engineering, techniques involve engineering a biomaterial so it will be broken down into its component parts. This method efficiently produces structures with long-range order along with macroscopic connections. A primary example of the top-down strategy in the field of medicine is the creation of small crystals from a bulk of mineralized tissue.

                <br><br>

                A more specific example of producing seed crystallites is the partial demineralization of mineralized collagen matrix by acids produced by bacteria. Top-down mineralization approaches are mostly preceded by existing seed crystallites to aid epitaxial growth. Throughout the evolution of biomineralization, the importance of matrix proteins are seen as they help regulate the mineral nucleation and growth even with the absence of seed crystallites.
                <br><br>


                Moreover, in the field of integrated circuit manufacture, a key advantage of this method is the removal of the assembly step. Generally because the parts are already patterned and built in place. The most common top-down strategy for this is lithographic patterning wherein short-wavelength optical sources are used for the refinement of microelectric chip manufacturing. Extreme ultraviolet and X-rays are also being developed to allow lithographic printing techniques to reach even dimensions of 10 to 100 nanometers.
                <br><br>


                In this approach the mechanical printing of nanoscale size is also possible. This involves the imprinting, stamping, and molding techniques which can reach dimensions of 20 to 40 nanometer size! This is achieved through several means but most commonly via high-resolution method stamping using electron-beam lithography which stamps or marks a material’s surface repeatedly to create a specific pattern.

                <br><br>

                Such nanoscale printing techniques offer several advantages as some can also be done in ordinary laboratories. The big challenge though is ensuring that when these submicron techniques are used in the nanoscale dimension, they will still exhibit the same efficiency. Additionally, it is hard to construct three-dimensional objects through this approach because the main principle of creating structures here is via addition and subtraction of patterned layers.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                <strong>Bottom-Up Strategy:</strong> This approach enables the formation of materials from the nanoscope dimension (i.e. molecules and atoms) to larger structures. This method utilizes physical and chemical forces to assemble basic units into large structures.

                <br><br>

                The principle of the bottom-up strategy came from biological systems – which were basically generated from the same chemical forces used to create the structures needed by life. Researches aim to mimic the same thing so that when small clusters of specific atoms are produced, they will automatically self-assemble into elaborate structures.  A sample of this self-assembly is when carbon nanotubes form under prime chemical and temperature conditions.


                <br><br>
                Biomineralization is also a specific type of process under this approach as it involves the regulation of amorphous phases via matrix proteins so that crystalline mineral units are formed in the nanoscopic dimension.

                <br><br>

                The characteristics for DNA-assisted assembly may also be studied to generate a method of integrating hybrid heterogenous parts into a single device or even to explore new methods of initiating self-assembly of molecules in the nanoscale dimension. Advantages of this approach are:
                    <br><br>
                <ul>
                <li>DNA molecules can easily be sequenced and replicated in large quantities;</li>

                <li>Sequences of the DNA act as codes so they can easily recognize their complementary pairs (notably, hybridized strands form stronger bonds to said complementary strands);</li>

                <li>and of course, such DNA strands can further be used as labels by joining them on to different devices.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                Other techniques under the realm of bottom-up strategy involves the condensation of atomic vapors on surfaces of liquids to induce coalescence of atoms. Even the inverse of globules of lipid molecules with polar hydrophobic tails jutting inward, have been further developed to produce size-selected particles for use in semiconductor and magnetic industries.
                </li>
                </ul>

                Biocontainment refers to a wide-range of containment measures to control the spread of infection which also deals with engineering controls that are not found in the traditional setup of hospital isolation wards. A biocontainment facility must consider these following factors:
                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">
                <li>The facility should provide protection to the patients via a unique and contained system with highly-trained staff on infectious diseases.</li>

                <li>The facility should protect other patients and the whole community from the threat of disease spread.</li>

                <li>The facility should protect the laboratory workers who will be dealing and handling pathogenic specimens.</li>

                <li>The facility should provide protection towards the healthcare worker/s.</li>
                </ul>
                In high facility setups, all involved personnel and operators must be well trained with an in-depth understanding of the characteristics of infectious diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) together with the National Institute of Health (NIH), prepared a risk assessment to develop the ascending biosafety levels of containment required when handling biological agents:
                <br><br>

                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">
                <li><strong>Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1):</strong> intended for work involving well-characterized agents not known to cause disease in healthy adult humans; of minimal potential hazard to personnel and environment.</li>

                <li><strong>Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2):</strong> intended for work when dealing with agents with moderate potential hazard to the personnel and the environment.</li>

                <li><strong>Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3):</strong> intended for handling indigenous pathogenic agents that may cause serious or potential lethal disease caused by exposure via inhalational route.</li>

                <li>Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4):</strong> intended for handling indigenous pathogenic agents possessing a high individual risk of aerosol-transmitted laboratory infection and possibly, life-threatening disease.</li>
                </ul>


                Risk levels were also established by the NIH under the guidelines on recombinant DNA:<br><br>
                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">
                <li><strong>Risk Group 1 (RG1):</strong> the agents being processed or handled do not have any associated disease with regards to healthy adult humans.</li>

                <li><strong>Risk Group 2 (RG2):</strong> the agents being processed or handled are associated with human disease but is rarely serious. Preventive or therapeutic interventions are already available for such diseases.</li>

                <li><strong>Risk Group 3 (RG3):</strong> the agents being processed or handled are associated with serious or lethal human disease, yet, preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available for them.</li>

                <li><strong>Risk Group 4 (RG4):</strong> the agents being processed or handled are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease, and preventive or therapeutic interventions are not available.</li>
                </ul>
                In developing a biocontainment facility, the institution must not only consider the type of agents to be handled and their associated risks; rather, even the architectural details including HVAC designs and structural requirements (i.e. emergency power) must be properly reviewed. The overall facility design must comply with any and all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.
                <br><br>
                Esco Pharma is equipped with isolation and barrier technologies to provide containment of pathogenic substances. These technologies isolate the whole process from the operators and the environment to provide protection from untoward exposure to possibly lethal pathogens. Any contagion risks are therefore, also prevented.
                <br><br>
                The range of different pressure-tight isolators Esco Pharma offers is a guarantee that a perfect fit is possible for each institution’s specific process. Negative pressurization is employed to ensure containment inside the system along with proper HEPA/ULPA filtered airflow for a Grade A or ISO Class 5 working environment. An integrated biodecontamination system (BioVap™) utilizing hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for a 6 log reduction in bioburden inside the isolator chambers, is one of the features offered. Additionally, customizations involving the integration of critical systems inside the isolator for a smooth and contained process, is also possible.

                Manufacturing semiconductors involves the combination of principles involving physics, chemistry, electricity, electronics, metallurgy, and more. Silicon is widely used in this industry as it is the element most suitable for patterning integrated components (circuits) like transistors; main reason is its characteristic to readily form an oxide coating around said components.
                <br><br>
                Silicon (Si) is the second most common element in the Earth’s crust and is usually found in its silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) state also-known-as silica sand. To achieve the metallurgical grade Silicon however, it needs to be freed from this compound via electric arc furnace through carbon reduction:
                <br><br>
                <center>SiO<sub>2</sub> + C &#x2192; CO<sub>2</sub>  + Si</center>
                <br><br>
                The resulting silicon grade is then possible for use in steel transformer but it is not pure enough for the semiconductor industry. To remedy this, silicon is converted to its chloride (SiCl<sub>4</sub> or SiHCl<sub>3</sub>) form and subsequently subjected to fractional distillation process. To further yield ultrapure silicon two different approaches can be taken:
                    <br>
                    <br>
               <ul>
                <li>reduction of the sample by ultrapure zinc or magnesium; or</li>

                <li>thermal decomposition on a hot polycrystalline silicon rod heater by hydrogen.</li>
                </ul>
                However, the most important method for the production of bulk single (Si) crystals for use in the electronic and/or optical material industry, is the Czochralski method (Cz).

                </p>
                <br>

                <center><p><em><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Steps of the Czochralski method.</em></p></center>
                <br><br>
                <p>Cz method allows the growth of dislocation wherein free silicon crystals (300 mm diameter) are produced for industrial use. During crystal growth via Cz, time dependent electromagnetic fields control the flow in electrically conducting melts for the manufacture of semiconductors.
                <br><br>
                On the other-hand, if the material that will be subjected to growth has components with a high partial pressure at its melting point, a modified Cz method can be done which is known as the Liquid Encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) method.

                </p>

                <center><p><em><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Liquid Encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) method..</em></p></center>
                <br><br>
                <p>LEC method is used for growing semiconductor compounds such as: GaAs, GaP, InP, PbSe, PbTe.
                <br><br>
                In this day and age the advancement of semiconductors for nanotechnology has increased, making it possible to achieve the purity of silicon used for its production, as high as 99.999999999% !

                Most semiconductors are based on ultrapure silicon because it is able to form a glass oxide on top of the wafer, which in turn, can be patterned with photolithography to enable the production of complex integrated circuits.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the manufacture of semiconductors, photolithography is critical. This refers to the production of metal lithographic printing plates through acid etching. To break it down, lithography is the process of producing the patterns on the semiconductor crystals that will be further used as integrated circuits. The principle behind this is the simple characteristic that oil and water do not mix. Lithographic plates are usually made from grained and anodized aluminium that has been subjected silicate to form a durable water-receptive surface. Said plates consist of:
                <ul class="image-list-style-ul-lg">
                <li>image areas: This part is oil-receptive (oleophilic) and therefore water repellent. Basically, an area for which printing is possible.</li>

                <li>non-image areas: The part of the plate where printing is not possible. This is therefore made from a water-receptive (hydrophilic) and oil-repellent (oleophobic) material.</li>
                </ul>

                These characteristics of the lithographic plate guarantee that when the printing plate is dampened by rollers, only the non-image areas are wetted; and when it is inked with rollers, the image areas easily accept the oily lithographic ink.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the electronics version, processing of copper printed circuit boards is involved. This is similar to the photolithographic steps of semiconductor processing.
                <br>
                <br>
                To summarize the process of manufacturing semiconductors, there are 30 simplified steps:

                <br><br>
                <p>In the manufacture of semiconductors, specific standards are set in place; from the design phase up to the fabrication and testing. As per the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), semicnductors device standards focus on IEC published series: IEC 60747, 62047, 61290, and 61292. Normally, the application the semiconductor is intended for dictates its properties.
                <br><br>
                It is critical to have a Grade A or ISO Class 5 environment in the manufacture of semiconductors to guarantee that no contamination will null the efficiency of these electronics.
